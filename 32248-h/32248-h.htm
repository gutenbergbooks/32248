<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;Standard Cantatas&rdquo; is the third of the
series in which the &ldquo;Standard Operas&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Standard Oratorios&rdquo; have been
its predecessors. Of necessity, therefore,
the same method has been followed in the arrangement
and presentation of the author&rsquo;s scheme. As
in the works above mentioned, short sketches of the
music and stories of the cantatas are presented,
together with biographies of their composers, some
of which are reproduced from the other volumes
with slight changes, the repetitions being necessary
for the sake of uniformity. The sketches are prefaced
by a comprehensive study of the cantata in its
various forms, from its early simple recitative or aria
style down to its present elaborate construction,
which sometimes verges closely upon that of the
opera or oratorio.</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;cantata&rdquo; is so flexible and covers
such a wide area in music, that it has been a work
<span class="pb" id="pg_4">[4]</span>
of some difficulty to decide upon the compositions
that properly come within the scheme of this volume.
During the past two centuries it has been
variously applied to songs, like those of the early
Italian school; to ballads, like those of the early
English composers; to concert arias, like those of
Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn; to short
operettas, dramatic scenas, cycles of ballads, and
even to oratorios, whose subjects are more or less
dramatic. It is believed, however, that the most
important of the modern cantatas are included in
the volume, and with them will be found several
works, such as the &ldquo;Damnation of Faust&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; vocal symphony and others,
which, though not in the strict cantata form, are
nevertheless compositions belonging to the concert-stage
for voices and orchestra, performed without
scenery, costumes, or stage accessories.</p>
<p>The author has paid particular attention to cantatas
by American composers, and has selected for
description and analysis those which in his estimation
rank the highest in musical merit. It would
be manifestly impossible to include in a volume of
the present size all the compositions by Americans
which have been called cantatas, for their number
is well-nigh &ldquo;legion.&rdquo; Those have been selected
which are creditable to American musical scholarship
and are making a name for American music.
It is possible some have been omitted which fulfil
these conditions; if so, it is only because they have
not come within the author&rsquo;s observation. The
<span class="pb" id="pg_5">[5]</span>
Appendix has been a work of great care, labor, and
research, and wherever it was practicable the date
of each cantata was verified.</p>
<p>Like its two predecessors, the &ldquo;Standard Cantatas&rdquo;
has been prepared for the general public,
which has not the time or opportunity to investigate
such matters, rather than for musicians, who are
presumed to be familiar with them. On this account
the text is made as untechnical as possible, and
description takes the place of criticism. The work
is intended to answer the purpose of a handbook
and guide which shall acquaint the reader with the
principal facts and accomplishments in this very
interesting form of composition. The favor so
generously accorded to the &ldquo;Standard Operas&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Standard Oratorios&rdquo; leads the author to hope
that this volume will also be welcome to music-lovers,
and will find a place by the side of its
companions in their libraries.</p>

<h2>THE STANDARD CANTATAS.</h2>
<div id="c002" title="The Cantata">
<h3>THE CANTATA.</h3>
<p>The origin of the cantata is a matter of
controversy, but it is clear that it had
its birth in Italy. Adami, an old writer,
attributes its invention to Giovanni Domenico
Poliaschi Romano, a papal chapel-singer,
who, it is claimed, wrote several cantatas as early as
1618. The same writer also asserts that the Cavalier
da Spoleto, a singer in the same service, published
cantatas in 1620. Hawkins asserts in one
chapter of his &ldquo;History of Music&rdquo; that the invention
is due to Carissimi, chapel-master of the Church of
St. Apollinare in Rome, who unquestionably did an
important service for dramatic music by perfecting
recitative and introducing stringed accompaniments;
but in a subsequent chapter the historian
states that Barbara Strozzi, a Venetian lady contemporary

with Carissimi, was the inventor, and assigns
the year 1653 as the date when she published certain
vocal compositions with the title &ldquo;Cantate, Ariette e
Duetti,&rdquo; prefixed by an advertisement setting forth
that having invented this form of music, she had
published them as an experiment. Burney takes
notice of the claim made for Romano and Da Spoleto,
but does not think it valid, and says: &ldquo;The
first time that I have found the term &lsquo;cantata&rsquo; used
for a short narrative lyric poem was in the <i>Musiche
varie a voce sola del Signor Benedetto Ferrari da
Reggio</i>, printed at Venice, 1638.&rdquo; This, as will be
observed, disposes of the Venetian lady&rsquo;s claim, as it
is antedated twenty years, and Burney states his facts
from personal investigation. He mentions several
cantatas written about this period, among them a
burlesque one describing the leap of Marcus Curtius
into the gulf. He concedes to Carissimi, however,
the transfer of the cantata from the chamber to the
church, and on this point nearly all the early writers
are agreed.</p>
<p>The cantata in its earliest form was a recitative,
which speedily developed into a mixture of recitative
and melody for a single voice, and was suggested
by the lyric opera. Burney says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The chief events were related in recitative. In
like manner they received several progressive changes
during the last century previous to their perfection.
First, they consisted, like opera scenes, of little more
than recitative, with frequent formal closes, at which
the singer, either accompanied by himself or another
<span class="pb" id="pg_15">[15]</span>
performer on a single instrument, was left at liberty to
show his taste and talents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The form then changed to a single air in triple
time, independent of the recitative, and repeated to
the different verses as in a ballad, the melody being
written every time, as the <i>Da Capo</i> was not then in
use.<sup><a id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></sup>
Choron defines the cantata as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;It is a little poem, which, considered in a literary
sense, has no very determinate character, though it is
usually the recital of a simple and interesting fact interspersed
with reflections or the expression of some
particular sentiment. It may be in all styles and all
characters, sacred, profane, heroic, comic, and even
ludicrous, representing the action or feeling of either
a single or several persons. It even sometimes assumes
the character of the oratorio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As applied to recitative, the new form was variously
called &ldquo;recitativo,&rdquo; &ldquo;musica parlante,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;stilo rappresentativo,&rdquo; one of the first works in
which style was &ldquo;The Complaint of Dido,&rdquo; by the
Cavalier Sigismondo d&rsquo;India, printed in Venice in
1623. The mixture of recitative and air was eventually
called &ldquo;ariose cantate;&rdquo; and with this title
several melodies were printed by Sebastian Enno at
Venice, 1655.<sup><a id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_16">[16]</div>
<p>The seventeenth century witnessed the rapid perfecting
of the cantata in its early forms by the Italian
composers. The best examples are said to have
been those of Carissimi, of whom mention has already
been made. Several of them are preserved
in the British Museum and at Oxford; among them,
one written on the death of Mary Queen of Scots.
Burney says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Of twenty-two of his cantatas preserved in the
Christ Church collection, Oxon., there is not one which
does not offer something that is still new, curious, and
pleasing; but most particularly in the recitatives, many
of which seem the most expressive, affecting, and perfect
that I have seen. In the airs there are frequently
sweet and graceful passages, which more than a hundred
years have not impaired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the thirteenth in this collection the same
authority says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;This single air, without recitative, seems the archetype
of almost all the <i>arie di cantabile</i>, the adagios, and
pathetic songs, as well as instrumental, slow movements,
that have since been made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fra Marc Antonio Cesti, in his later life a monk
in the monastery of Arezzo, and chapel-master of
the Emperor Ferdinand III., was a pupil of Carissimi,
and devoted much attention to the cantata, the
recitative of which he greatly improved. One of
his most celebrated compositions of this kind was
entitled, &ldquo;O cara Liberta,&rdquo; and selections from it
are given both by Burney and Hawkins. He must
<span class="pb" id="pg_17">[17]</span>
have been one of the jolly monks of old, for all
his cantatas are secular in character, and he was
frequently censured for devoting so much time to
theatrical instead of church music. Luigi Rossi was
contemporary with Cesti, and has left several cantatas
which are conspicuous for length and pedantry
rather than for elegance or melodious charm.
Giovanni Legrenzi of Bergamo, the master of Lotti
and Gasparini, published twenty-four cantatas in
Venice between 1674 and 1679, which were great
favorites in his time. The celebrated painter Salvator
Rosa not only wrote the words for many cantatas
by his musical friends, but it is known that he
composed both words and music to eight. The
texts of these works have preserved for posterity
pictures more graphic than any he could paint of
his misanthropical character; for when he is not
railing against his mistress he is launching satires
against Nature and mankind in general. In one
of these he complains that the earth is barren and
the sun is dark. If he goes out to see a friend, it
always rains. If he goes on shipboard, it always
storms. If he buys provisions at the market, the
bones outweigh the flesh. If he goes to court&mdash;</p>

<p class="t0">&ldquo;The attendants at my dress make sport;</p>
<p class="t0">Point at my garb, threadbare and shabby,</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>His only wealth is hope, which points to nothing
better than &ldquo;workhouse or a rope.&rdquo; In the heat of
summer he has to trudge in winter clothes. He
cannot even run away from misfortune. In a word,
<span class="pb" id="pg_18">[18]</span>
nothing pleases the poor painter, as is evident from
the gloomy moral which &ldquo;adorns the tale&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">

<p>In 1703 Giambatista Bassani, of Bologna, published
twelve cantatas devoted to the tender passion,
and all of them set to a violin accompaniment,&mdash;a
practice first introduced by Scarlatti, of Naples, who
was one of the most prolific writers of his day.
The cantata was Scarlatti&rsquo;s favorite form of composition,
and hundreds of them came from his busy
pen, which were noted for their beauty and originality.
The accompaniments were written for the
violoncello as well as for the violin; those for the
first-named instrument were so difficult and yet so
excellent that those who could perform them were
often thought to have supernatural assistance.<sup><a id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></sup>
Contemporary with Scarlatti was Francesco Gasparini,
a Roman composer and harpsichord player of
such eminence that Scarlatti sent his son Domenico,
who afterwards became famous by his musical
<span class="pb" id="pg_19">[19]</span>
achievements, to study with him. Gasparini wrote
twelve cantatas,&mdash;not so scholarly but quite as
popular as those by Scarlatti. As a return for the
compliment which Scarlatti had paid him,
Gasparini sent him a cantata, which was the
signal for a lively cantata-correspondence between them, each
trying to outdo the other. Following Gasparini came
Bononcini, whose contentions with Handel in England
are familiar to all musical readers. He was
the most prolific cantata-writer of all the Italians
next to Scarlatti, and dedicated a volume of them,
in 1721, to the King of England. He also published
in Germany a large number which show
great knowledge of instrumentation, according
to the musical historians of his time. Antonio
Lotti, his contemporary, wrote several which are
particularly noticeable for their harmony. His pupil
Benedetto Marcello, the illustrious psalm-composer,
excelled his master in this form of music.
Two of his cantatas, &ldquo;Il Timoteo&rdquo; (after Dryden&rsquo;s
ode) and &ldquo;Cassandra,&rdquo; were very celebrated. He
was of noble family, and is famous even to this day
by his masses, serenades, and sonnets, and by his
beautiful poetical and musical paraphrase of the
Psalms, which was translated into English, German,
and Russian. The Baron d&rsquo;Astorga, whose &ldquo;Stabat
Mater&rdquo; is famous, wrote many cantatas, but they
do not reach the high standard of that work. Antonio
Caldara, for many years composer to the
Emperor at Vienna, published a volume of them
at Venice in 1699. Porpora, who was a rival of
<span class="pb" id="pg_20">[20]</span>
Handel in England as an opera composer, published
and dedicated twelve to the Prince of Wales in
1735 as a mark of gratitude for the support which
he had given him in his disputes with the testy German.<sup><a id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></sup>
After Pergolesi, who made himself famous
by his &ldquo;Stabat Mater,&rdquo; and published several
cantatas at Rome, and Handel, who wrote many,
which were eclipsed by his operas and oratorios,
and are now hardly known, this style of the cantata
languished, and gradually passed into the form of
the concert aria, of which fine examples are to be
found in the music of Mozart, Beethoven, and
Mendelssohn. After the death of Pergolesi, Sarti
and Paisiello made an attempt to revive it, and in
so doing prepared the way for the cantata in its
beautiful modern form. In the latter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guinone
Lucina,&rdquo; written for the churching of Caroline of
Austria, Queen of Naples, and in his &ldquo;Dafne ed
Alceo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Retour de Pers&eacute;e&rdquo; the melody is intermixed
with choruses for the first time.</p>
<p>Thus far the Italian cantatas have alone been considered;
but it must not be supposed that this form
of composition was confined to Italy. In France
it was also a favorite style in the early part of the
eighteenth century. Montclair, Campra, Mouret,
Batistin, Clerambault, and Rousseau excelled in it.
M. Ginguen&eacute;, in the &ldquo;Encyclop&aelig;dia Methodique,&rdquo;
says of these composers and their works:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_21">[21]</div>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;They have left collections in which may be
discovered among all the faults of the age, when Italian
music was unknown in France, much art and knowledge
of harmony, happy traits of melody, well-worked
basses, and above all recitatives in which the accent
of declamation and the character of the language are
strictly observed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Germany, however, the cantata at this time
was approximating to its present form. Koch, a
celebrated musical scholar of the early part of the
present century, says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The cantata is a lyrical poem set to music in different,
alternating compositions, and sung with the
accompaniment of instrumental music. The various
melodies of which the whole is composed are the aria,
with its subordinate species, the recitative or accompaniment,
and the arioso, frequently also intermixed
with choruses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heydenreich, another writer of the same period,
says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The cantata is always lyrical. Its distinctive
character lies in the aptitude of the passions and feelings
which it contains to be rendered by music. The
cantata ought to be a harmonious whole of ideas poetically
expressed, concurring to paint a main passion
or feeling, susceptible of various kinds and degrees of
musical expression. It sometimes may have the character
of the hymn or ode, sometimes that of the elegy,
or of a mixture of these, in which, however, one particular
emotion must predominate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church cantata, according to Du Cange, dates
back to 1314; but subsequent writers have shown
<span class="pb" id="pg_22">[22]</span>
that the term prior to the seventeenth century was
used indiscriminately and without reference to any
well-defined style of vocal music, and that as applied
to church compositions it meant the anthem
such as we now have, although not as elaborate.
The noblest examples of the sacred cantata are
those by Sebastian Bach, three hundred and eighty
in all, over a hundred of which have been published
under the auspices of the Bach-Gesellschaft. They
are written in from four to seven movements for four
voices and full orchestra, usually opening with chorus
and closing with a chorale, the intermediate movements
being in the form of recitatives, arias, and
duets. The text of these cantatas is either a literal
transcription of the Gospel or of portions of it.
In the latter case the Gospel of the Sunday for which
the cantata was written is introduced entire in the
body of the work as the nucleus around which the
great composer grouped the remaining parts. For
instance, the cantata for Sexagesima Sunday turns
upon the parable of the sower, and this being the
Gospel for the day is made its central point. In like
manner the cantata for the fourteenth Sunday after
Trinity has for its subject the story of the ten lepers,
which is introduced in recitative form in the middle
of the work. The astonishing industry of Bach is
shown by the fact that for nearly five years he produced
a new cantata for each Sunday, in addition to
his numerous fugues, chorales, motets, magnificats,
masses, sanctuses, glorias, and other church music.
The artistic sincerity and true genius of the old master
<span class="pb" id="pg_23">[23]</span>
also reveal themselves in the skill with which he
finished these works for the congregation of St.
Thomas,&mdash;few of whom, it is to be feared, had any
conception of their real merit,&mdash;and in the untiring
regularity with which he produced them, unrewarded
by the world&rsquo;s applause, and little dreaming that long
years after he had passed away they would be brought
to light again, be published to the world, and command
its admiration and astonishment on account of
their beauty and scholarship.<sup><a id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></sup>
Before passing to the
consideration of the cantata in its present form, the
following abridged description of those written by
Bach, taken from Bitter&rsquo;s Life of the composer, will
be of interest:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The directors who preceded Bach at Leipsic used
to choose the cantatas or motets to be sung in the
churches quite arbitrarily, without any regard to their
connection with the rest of the service. But Bach felt
that unless these elaborate pieces of music were really
made a means of edification, they were mere intellectual
pastimes suitable for a concert, but an interruption to
divine worship; and he thought that they could best
edify the congregation if their subjects were the themes
to which attention was specially directed in the service
and sermon of the day. He therefore made it
a rule to ascertain from the clergymen of the four
<span class="pb" id="pg_24">[24]</span>
churches the texts of the sermons for the following
Sunday, and to choose cantatas on the same or corresponding
texts. As most of the clergy were in the
habit of preaching on the Gospel of the day, the service
thus became a harmonious whole, and the attention
of the congregation was not divided between a
variety of subjects. The clergyman of highest standing
at Leipsic, Superintendent Deyling, a preacher of
great eloquence and theological learning, co-operated
heartily with Bach in this scheme. A series of cantatas
for every Sunday and festival for five years&mdash;about
three hundred and eighty in all&mdash;was composed
by Bach, chiefly during the first years of his stay at
Leipsic. Unfortunately many of these are lost; but
one hundred and eighty-six for particular days, and
thirty-two without any days specified, still remain.
Their music is so completely in character with the
subject of the words as to form a perfect exposition
of the text. In some the orchestral introductions and
accompaniments are made illustrative of the scene of
the text; as for instance in one on Christ&rsquo;s appearing
to His disciples in the evening after His resurrection,
the introduction is of a soft, calming character, representing
the peacefulness of evening and of the whole
scene. Another, on the text &lsquo;Like as the rain and
snow fall from heaven,&rsquo; is introduced by a symphony
in which the sound of gently-falling rain is imitated.
In others the instrumental parts and some of the voices
express the feelings excited by meditation on the words.
Sometimes, in the midst of a chorus in which the words
of the text are repeated, and, as it were, commented on,
a single voice, with the accompaniment of a few instruments,
breaks off into some well-known hymn in a
similar strain of thought or feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_25">[25]</div>
<p>Handel in his younger days wrote many cantatas
for the church, though they are now but little known.
The entire list numbers one hundred and fifty. On
his return from England to his post of chapel-master
at Hanover in 1711 he composed twelve,
known as the Hanover cantatas, for the Princess
Caroline, the words written by the Abb&eacute; Hortentio
Mauro, to which no objection was offered by Handel&rsquo;s
master and patron, notwithstanding he was a
Lutheran prince. Several written in England are
still preserved in the royal collections. On Holy
Week of the year 1704, the same week in which
Reinhardt Kaiser brought out his famous Passion
oratorio, &ldquo;The Bleeding and Dying Jesus,&rdquo; Handel&rsquo;s
Passion cantata was first produced. Kaiser&rsquo;s
work had been denounced as secular by the pastors,
because it did not contain the words of Holy Scripture.
Handel&rsquo;s was founded on the nineteenth
chapter of St. John, and thus escaped the pulpit
denunciation. This cantata is sometimes called the First
Passion Oratorio, the second having been written at Hamburg in
1716.<sup><a id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></sup>
In 1707 Handel was in Florence, where he wrote several cantatas, and
thence went to Rome, where he produced some
church music in the same form, notably the &ldquo;Dixit
<span class="pb" id="pg_26">[26]</span>
Dominus,&rdquo; for five voices and orchestra; &ldquo;Nisi
Dominus,&rdquo; also for five voices; and &ldquo;Laudate
pueri,&rdquo; for solos and full orchestral accompaniment.
The famous anthems written for the private chapel
of James Brydges, Duke of Chandos, familiarly
known as the Chandos Anthems, are in reality
cantatas, as each one is preceded by an overture
and in its structural form comprises solos, choruses,
and instrumentation for full band and choir. It is
also noteworthy that it was during Handel&rsquo;s residence
at the Duke&rsquo;s palace at Cannons that he
wrote his first English oratorio, the legitimate successor
of the Chandos Anthems, and the precursor of
the great works destined to immortalize his name.</p>
<p>The cantatas left by Haydn are mainly secular
in character; but it may well be imagined that
during the days of his early married life, when his
fanatical and termagant spouse was forcing him to
write so much music for the priests and monks
whom she entertained so sumptuously below-stairs
while he was laboring above, more than one cantata
must have come from his pen, which would have
been preserved had he not reluctantly parted company
with them to pacify his wife.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;cantata,&rdquo; as it is now used, is very
elastic, and covers a range of compositions which
are too large to be considered as dramatic arias or
ballads,&mdash;though ballads are sometimes written for
various voices and orchestra,&mdash;and too small to be
called operas or oratorios. It can best be defined,
perhaps, as a lyric narrative, sacred, didactic, or
<span class="pb" id="pg_27">[27]</span>
dramatic in character, set to music for the concert
stage only, being without <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> in the
theatrical acceptation of those words. Its general
form is that of the oratorio, being for solo voices,
usually the quartet, full chorus, and orchestra, though
its shortness as compared with the oratorio adapts
it to performance by a small chorus, and sometimes
with only piano accompaniment. Among the most
perfect forms of the modern cantatas are such works
as Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Walpurgis Night,&rdquo; Sterndale
Bennett&rsquo;s &ldquo;May Queen,&rdquo; Max Bruch&rsquo;s &ldquo;Odysseus&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Frithjof&rsquo;s Saga,&rdquo; Cowen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo;
Gade&rsquo;s &ldquo;Comala,&rdquo; Hiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Song of Victory,&rdquo; Romberg&rsquo;s
somewhat antiquated &ldquo;Song of the Bell,&rdquo;
Sullivan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden Legend,&rdquo; Randegger&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fridolin,&rdquo;
and Dudley Buck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Don Munio&rdquo; and &ldquo;Light
of Asia.&rdquo; But besides such as these there are numerous
other works, not usually classed as cantatas,
which clearly belong to the same musical family;
such as Berlioz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Damnation of Faust,&rdquo; Brahms&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Triumphlied,&rdquo; Mendelssohn&rsquo;s settings of various
Psalms, Handel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Acis and Galatea&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alexander&rsquo;s
Feast,&rdquo; Hofmann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Melusina,&rdquo; Liszt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prometheus,&rdquo;
Rheinberger&rsquo;s &ldquo;Toggenberg,&rdquo; Schubert&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Song of Miriam,&rdquo; Schumann&rsquo;s ballads and &ldquo;Advent
Hymn,&rdquo; and Weber&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kampf und Sieg.&rdquo;
These and others of the same kin are drawn upon
as illustrations and for analysis in the pages which follow.</p>
<p>Considering the possibilities of the cantata, its
adaptability to every form of narrative, and the
<span class="pb" id="pg_28">[28]</span>
musical inducements it holds out, particularly in
these days, when a new opera or oratorio must be
of extraordinary merit to suit the public, it is somewhat
remarkable that no more of them are written.
Mr. Charles Barnard has made this point very aptly
and forcibly in a short article printed in the &ldquo;Century&rdquo;
for January, 1886, in which he urges the
cantata form of composition upon our writers, and
makes many excellent suggestions.<sup><a id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></sup>
It is certainly an inviting field, especially to American composers,
among whom but three or four have as yet produced
works of this kind possessing real merit.</p>
<div class="fnblock">
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_1" href="#fr_1">[1]</a></sup> Its first use is to be found in the opera of &ldquo;Enea,&rdquo;
performed at Genoa in 1676. Before 1680 it was universally adopted.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a></sup> It is noteworthy that in this volume occur for the first time
the musical terms &ldquo;adagio,&rdquo; &ldquo;piu adagio,&rdquo; &ldquo;affetuoso,&rdquo; &ldquo;presto,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;allegro.&rdquo; In the &ldquo;Cantate da Camera a voce sola,&rdquo; published
at Bologna (1677) by Gio. Bat. Mazzaferrata, the terms &ldquo;vivace,&rdquo;
&ldquo;largo,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ardito&rdquo; are also found for the first time.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_3" href="#fr_3">[3]</a></sup> Geminiani
used to relate that Franceschelli, a celebrated performer
on the violoncello at the beginning of this century, accompanied
one of these cantatas at Rome so admirably, while Scarlatti
was at the harpsichord, that the company, being good Catholics,
and living in a country where miraculous powers have not yet
ceased, were firmly persuaded it was not Franceschelli who had
played the violoncello, but an angel that had descended and assumed
his shape.&mdash;<i>Burney&rsquo;s History</i>, vol. iv. p. 169 (1789).
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_4" href="#fr_4">[4]</a></sup> Doctor
Arbuthnot, in a humorous pamphlet called out by the operatic
war, entitled &ldquo;Harmony in an Uproar,&rdquo; calls Handel the
Nightingale, and Porpora the Cuckoo.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_5" href="#fr_5">[5]</a></sup> It is curious to remember that
the sacred cantatas were not
composed for universal fame or for a musical public, but for the use
of congregations who probably looked on them as a necessary part
of the service, and thought little about the merits of their composition.
In those days art-criticism was in its infancy, and they were
scarcely noticed beyond the walls of Leipsic till after the
composer&rsquo;s death.&mdash;<i>Bitter&rsquo;s Life of Bach</i>.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_6" href="#fr_6">[6]</a></sup> Handel&rsquo;s Second German Passion, as it is now generally called,
differs entirely from the earlier Passion according to St. John, and
bears no analogy at all to the Passion Music of Sebastian Bach.
The choruses are expressive or vigorous in accordance with the
nature of the words; but none exhibit any very striking form of
contrapuntal development; nor do they ever rise to the grandeur
of the Utrecht Te Deum or Jubilate.&mdash;<i>Rockstro&rsquo;s Life of Handel</i>.

<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_7" href="#fr_7">[7]</a></sup> The following list of cantatas by Americans hardly sustains

<h3>BACH.</h3>
<p>Johann Sebastian Bach, the most
eminent of the world&rsquo;s organ-players
and contrapuntists, was born at Eisenach,
March 21, 1685, and was the most
illustrious member of a long line of musicians, the
Bach family having been famous almost from time
immemorial for its skill in music. He first studied
the piano with his brother, Johann Christoph, and
the organ with Reinecke in Hamburg, and Buxtehude
in L&uuml;beck. In 1703 he was court musician
in Weimar, and afterwards was engaged as organist
in Arnstadt and M&uuml;hlhausen. In 1708 he was
court organist, and in 1714 concert-master in
Weimar. In 1718 he was chapel-master to the
Prince von K&ouml;then, and in 1723 was appointed
music-director and cantor at the St. Thomas School
in Leipsic,&mdash;a position which he held during the
remainder of his life. He has left for the admiration
of posterity an almost endless list of vocal and
instrumental works, including cantatas, chorales,
motets, magnificats, masses, fugues, sonatas, and
<span class="pb" id="pg_30">[30]</span>
fantasies, the &ldquo;Christmas Oratorio,&rdquo; and several
settings of the Passion, of which the most famous
are the &ldquo;St. John&rdquo; and &ldquo;St. Matthew,&rdquo; the latter
of which Mendelssohn re-introduced to the world
in 1829, after it had slumbered an entire century.
His most famous instrumental work is the &ldquo;Well-tempered
Clavichord,&rdquo;&mdash;a collection of forty-eight
fugues and preludes, which was written for his
second wife, Anna Magdalena Bach, to whom he
also dedicated a large number of piano pieces and
songs. His first wife was his cousin, Maria Barbara
Bach, the youngest daughter of Johann Michael
Bach, a composer of no common ability. By these
two wives he had twenty-one children, of whom the
most celebrated were Carl Phillipp Emanuel, born in
1714, known as the &ldquo;Berlin Bach;&rdquo; Johann Christoph
Friedrich, born in 1732, the &ldquo;B&uuml;cheburger
Bach;&rdquo; and Johann Christian, born in 1735, who
became famous as the &ldquo;London Bach.&rdquo; Large as
the family was, it is now extinct. Bach was industrious,
simple, honest, and God-fearing, like all his
family. He was an incessant and laborious writer
from necessity, as his compensation was hardly
sufficient to maintain his large family, and nearly all
his music was prepared for the service of the church
by contract. The prominent characteristics of his
work are profound knowledge, the clearest statements
of form, strength of logical sequences, imposing
breadth, and deep religious sentiment. The
latter quality was the outcome of his intense religious
nature. Upon everyone of his principal
<span class="pb" id="pg_31">[31]</span>
compositions he inscribed &ldquo;S. D. G.,&rdquo; &ldquo;to the
glory of God alone.&rdquo; He died July 28, 1750, and
was buried at Leipsic; but no cross or stone marks
the spot where he lies. His last composition was
the beautiful chorale, &ldquo;Wenn wir in h&ouml;chsten
N&ouml;then sein,&rdquo; freely translated, &ldquo;When my last
hour is close at hand,&rdquo; as it was written in his last
illness. The only record of his death is contained
in the official register: &ldquo;A man, aged sixty-seven,
M. Johann Sebastian Bach, musical director and
singing-master at the St. Thomas School, was carried
to his grave in the hearse, July 30, 1750.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div id="c004" title="Ich hatte viel Bek&uuml;mmerniss">
<h4>Ich hatte viel Bek&uuml;mmerniss.</h4>
<p>The cantata with the above title, best known in
English as &ldquo;My Heart was full of Heaviness,&rdquo; was
the first sacred piece in this form which Bach wrote.
Its date is 1714, in which year he was living at
Weimar, and its composition grew out of a difficulty
which he had with the elders of the Liebfrauenkirche
at Halle, touching his application for the position of
organist. It occasioned him great sorrow, and it
was while in this sad plight that he wrote the cantata.
It was composed for the third Sunday after
Trinity, June 17, and consists of eleven numbers,&mdash;an
instrumental prelude, four choruses, three arias,
a duet, and two recitatives.</p>
<p>The prelude, which is brief and quiet in character,
introduces the opening chorus (&ldquo;Deep within my
Heart was Sorrowing and great Affliction&rdquo;), which
<span class="pb" id="pg_32">[32]</span>
in turn leads to the first aria (&ldquo;Sighing, Mourning,
Sorrow, Tears waste away my troubled Heart&rdquo;), a
tender and beautiful number for soprano, with oboe
and string accompaniment. It is followed by the
tenor recitative and aria, &ldquo;Why hast Thou, O my
God, in my sore Need so turned Thy Face from
me?&rdquo; in which the feeling of sorrow is intensified
in utterance. The chorus, &ldquo;Why, my Soul, art
thou vexed?&rdquo; a very pathetic number, closes the
mournful but beautiful first part of the cantata.</p>
<p>The second part is more tranquil and hopeful.
It opens with a duet for soprano and bass, the two
parts representing the soul and Christ, and sustaining
a most expressive dialogue, leading up to a
richly harmonized chorus (&ldquo;O my Soul, be content
and be thou peaceful&rdquo;) in which a chorale
is introduced with consummate skill. A graceful
tenor aria with a delightful and smoothly flowing
accompaniment (&ldquo;Rejoice, O my Soul, change
Weeping to Smiling&rdquo;) follows and leads to the
final number, which is based on the same subject as
that of the &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo; in Handel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Messiah.&rdquo;
All the voices give out the words, &ldquo;The Lamb that
for us is slain, to Him will we render Power and
Glory,&rdquo; with majestic effect; after which the solo
bass utters the theme, &ldquo;Power and Glory and
Praise be unto Him forevermore,&rdquo; introducing the
&ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; which closes the work in a burst of
tremendous power, by voices and instruments.</p>
</div>
<div id="c005" title="Gottes Zeit">
<div class="pb" id="pg_33">[33]</div>
<h4>Gottes Zeit.</h4>
<p>During the first half of the period in which Bach
resided at Weimar, occupying the position of court
and chamber musician to Duke Wilhelm Ernst, he
wrote three cantatas in the old church form which
are notable as being the last he composed before
adopting the newer style, and as the most perfect of
that kind extant. The first of these, &ldquo;Nach dir,
Herr, verlanget mich,&rdquo; is based upon the first two
verses of the Twenty-fifth Psalm. The second, &ldquo;Aus
der Tiefe rufe ich,&rdquo; includes the whole of the One
hundred and thirtieth Psalm and two verses of the
hymn &ldquo;Herr Jesu Christ, du h&ouml;chstes Gut.&rdquo; The
third and most famous of the trio, &ldquo;Gottes Zeit ist
die allerbeste Zeit&rdquo; (&ldquo;God&rsquo;s time is the best of
all&rdquo;), is generally known as the &ldquo;Actus Tragicus,&rdquo;
and sometimes as the &ldquo;Mourning Cantata.&rdquo; Of its
origin Spitta says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Judging by its contents it was designed for the
mourning for some man, probably of advanced age, to
whom the song of Simeon could be suitably applied.
No such death took place in the ducal house at this
time, for Prince Johann Ernst died when a youth, and
also when Bach&rsquo;s style of composition had reached a
different stage. Possibly the cantata has reference to
Magister Philipp Grossgebauer, the rector of the
Weimar school before its reorganization, who died in
1711; at least, I can find no other suitable occasion.
The contrast between the spirit of the Old and New
Testaments,&mdash;between the wrath of an avenging God
<span class="pb" id="pg_34">[34]</span>
and the atoning love of Christ,&mdash;which had already
appeared in the One hundred and thirtieth Psalm, is
the germ and root of this cantata to such a degree that
it is evident that Bach had fully realized by this time
how fertile a subject for treatment it was. It contains
no chorus of such depth and force as those of the One
hundred and thirtieth Psalm. Its character is much
more entirely individual and personal, and so it has a
depth and intensity of expression which reach the extreme
limits of possibility of representation by music.
The arrangement of the poetic material is most excellent;
it does not wholly consist of Scripture texts and
verses of hymns; and in several fit and expressive
thoughts, which are freely interspersed, we can almost
recognize Bach&rsquo;s own hand. If such be the case, the
whole arrangement of the poetry may with reason be
ascribed to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The introduction to the work is a quiet, tender
movement in sonata form, written for two flutes,
two viol-da-gambas and figured bass, which gives out
some of the themes in the middle of the cantata.
The opening chorus (&ldquo;God&rsquo;s own Time is the best,
ever best of all. In Him we live, move, and have
our Being, as long as He wills. And in Him we
die at His good Time&rdquo;) is very descriptive in character,
opening with a slow and solemn movement,
then passing to a quick fugue, and closing with
phrases of mournful beauty to suit the last sentence
of the text. A tenor solo follows, set to the
words, &ldquo;O Lord, incline us to consider that our
Days are numbered; make us apply our Hearts unto
Wisdom,&rdquo; and accompanied by the flutes, leading
<span class="pb" id="pg_35">[35]</span>
into a mournful aria for the bass, which forms the
second part of the tenor solo (&ldquo;Set in order thine
House, for thou shalt die and not live&rdquo;). The choir
resumes with a new theme (&ldquo;It is the old Decree,
Man, thou art mortal&rdquo;), in which the lower voices
carry a double fugue, the soprano sings alone (&ldquo;Yea,
come, Lord Jesus&rdquo;), and the instruments have the
melody of the old hymn:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I have cast all my care on God,</p>
<p class="t0">E&rsquo;en let Him do what seems Him good;</p>
<p class="t0">Whether I die, or whether live,</p>
<p class="t2">No more I&rsquo;ll strive.</p>
<p class="t0">But all my will to Him will give.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Of this effective movement and its successor
Spitta says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The design is clear. The curse of death has been
changed into blessing by the coming of Christ, and
that which mankind dreaded before, they now stretch
out entreating hands to; the bliss of the new condition
of things shines out in supernatural glory against
the dark background of a dispensation that has been
done away. This is the idea of the concerted vocal
parts; and the fact that thousands upon thousands
have agreed in the joy of this faith is shown by the
chorale tune now introduced; for to the understanding
listener its worldless sounds convey the whole import
of the hymn which speaks so sweetly of comfort in the
hour of death, sounds which must recall to every pious
heart all the feelings they had stirred when, among the
chances and changes of life, this hymn had been heard,&mdash;feelings
of sympathy with another&rsquo;s grief or of balm
to the heart&rsquo;s own anxiety.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_36">[36]</div>
<p>The alto voice follows with the words spoken on
the cross (&ldquo;Into Thy Hands my Spirit I commend&rdquo;),
to which the bass replies in an arioso (&ldquo;Thou shalt
be with Me to-day in Paradise&rdquo;). The next number
is a chorale (&ldquo;In Joy and Peace I pass away
whenever God willeth&rdquo;) sung by the alto, the bass
continuing its solo at the same time through a portion
of the chorale. The final chorus is the so-called
fifth Gloria:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All glory, praise, and majesty</p>
<p class="t0">To Father, Son, and Spirit be,</p>
<p class="t0">The holy, blessed Trinity;</p>
<p class="t3">Whose power to us</p>
<p class="t3">Gives victory</p>
<p class="t0">Through Jesus Christ.    Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The &ldquo;Actus Tragicus&rdquo; was one of the youthful compositions
of Bach, but it has always attracted the
notice of the best musical critics. It was a great
favorite with Mendelssohn. Spitta says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;It is a work of art well rounded off and firm in
its formation, and warmed by the deepest intensity of
feeling even in the smallest details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hauptmann writes to Jahn:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Yesterday, at the Euterpe concert, Bach&rsquo;s &lsquo;Gottes
Zeit&rsquo; was given. What a marvellous intensity pervades
it, without a bar of conventionality! Of the
cantatas known to me, I know none in which such
design and regard are had to the musical import and
its expression.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div id="c006" title="Festa Ascensionis Christi">
<div class="pb" id="pg_37">[37]</div>
<h4>Festa Ascensionis Christi.</h4>
<p>The cantata beginning with the words, &ldquo;Wer
da glaubet und getauft wird&rdquo; (&ldquo;Whoso believeth
and is baptized&rdquo;), commonly known as the Ascension
cantata, was written for four voices, with
accompaniment of two oboes, two violins, viola,
and &ldquo;continuo,&rdquo;&mdash;the latter word implying a bass
part, the harmonies indicated by figures from which
the organist built up his own accompaniment. The
original score has been lost; but it has been reconstructed
from the parts, which are preserved in the
Royal Library at Berlin.</p>
<p>The cantata is in five numbers. A short prelude
of a quiet and cheerful character introduces the
stately opening chorus (&ldquo;Who believeth and obeyeth
will be blest forever&rdquo;). Another brief prelude
prepares the way for the brilliant tenor aria (&ldquo;Of
Love, Faith is the Pledge and Token&rdquo;), which
leads up to the chorale, &ldquo;Lord God, my Father,
holy One,&rdquo; based upon the old chorale, &ldquo;Wie
sch&ouml;n leucht uns der Morgenstern&rdquo; (&ldquo;How
brightly shines the Morning Star&rdquo;), which has always
been a favorite in the church service, and
which more than one composer has chosen for the
embellishment of his themes. The chorale is not
employed in its original form, but is elaborated
with all the contrapuntal skill for which Bach was
so famous. The next number is a short recitative
for the bass voice (&ldquo;Ye Mortals, hear, all ye who
<span class="pb" id="pg_38">[38]</span>
would behold the Face of God&rdquo;), and leads to a
stately bass aria (&ldquo;Through Faith the Soul has
Eagle&rsquo;s Pinions&rdquo;). The cantata closes, after the
customary manner of Bach, with a strong, earnest
chorale (&ldquo;Oh, give me Faith, my Father!&rdquo;), in
plain, solid harmony, for the use of the congregation,
thus forming an effective devotional climax to
the work.</p>

<p>There is now but little question that Martin
Luther not only wrote the words but the music
of the grand old hymn, the first and third stanzas
of which, taken from Carlyle&rsquo;s free and rugged
<span class="pb" id="pg_39">[39]</span>
translation, are given above. Sleidan, a contemporary
historian, indeed says that &ldquo;Luther made
a tune for it singularly suited to the words and
adapted to stir the heart.&rdquo; The date of its composition
is a matter of controversy; but it is clear
that it must have been either in 1529 or 1530, and
most writers agree that it was just before the Diet
at Augsburg, where it was sung. Niederer, in a
work published at Nuremberg, 1759, fixes the date
as 1530, and finds it in Preussen&rsquo;s psalm-book,
printed in 1537. Winterfeld observes it for the
first time in the &ldquo;Gesangbuch&rdquo; of the composer
Walther, a friend of Luther. Its usual title is,
&ldquo;Der XLVI. Psalm: Deus noster Refugium et
virtus, pp. D., Martin Luther.&rdquo; It matters little,
however, the exact year in which the sturdy old
Reformer wrote the hymn which has stirred the
human heart more than any other. It is indissolubly
connected with his name, and every line of
it is a reflex of his indomitable and God-fearing
nature. Heine and Carlyle have paid it noble
tributes. The German poet says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The hymn which he composed on his way to Worms,<sup><a id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></sup>
and which he and his companions chanted
as they entered that city, is a regular war-song. The
old cathedral trembled when it heard these novel
sounds. The very rooks flew from their nests in the
towers. That hymn, the Marseillaise of the Reformation,
<span class="pb" id="pg_40">[40]</span>
has preserved to this day its potent spell over
German hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carlyle still more forcibly says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;With words he had now learned to make music;
it was by deeds of love or heroic valor that he spoke
freely. Nevertheless, though in imperfect articulation,
the same voice, if we listen well, is to be heard
also in his writings, in his poems. The one entitled
&lsquo;Ein&rsquo; feste Burg,&rsquo; universally regarded as the best,
jars upon our ears; yet there is something in it like
the sound of Alpine avalanches, or the first murmur
of earthquakes, in the very vastness of which dissonance
a higher unison is revealed to us. Luther wrote
this song in times of blackest threatenings, which,
however, could in no sense become a time of despair.
In these tones, rugged and broken as they are, do we
hear the accents of that summoned man, who answered
his friends&rsquo; warning not to enter Worms, in this wise:
&lsquo;Were there as many devils in Worms as these tile
roofs, I would on.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the battle-song of the Reformation, stirring
men to valiant deeds; and it did equal service
in sustaining and consoling the Reformers in their
darkest hours. &ldquo;Come, Philip, let us sing the
Forty-sixth Psalm,&rdquo; was Luther&rsquo;s customary greeting
to Melanchthon, when the gentler spirit quailed
before approaching danger, or success seemed
doubtful. In music it has frequently served an
important purpose. Not only Bach, but other composers
of his time arranged it. Mendelssohn uses
it with powerful effect in his Reformation symphony.
<span class="pb" id="pg_41">[41]</span>
Nicolai employs it in his Fest overture.
Meyerbeer more than once puts it in the mouth of
Marcel the Huguenot, when dangers gather about
his master, though the Huguenots were not Lutherans
but Calvinists; and Wagner introduces it
with overwhelming power in his triumphal Kaiser
March.</p>
<p>Bitter, in his Life of Bach, says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The bicentenary Reformation Festival was celebrated
in October and November, 1717, and at Weimar
especially it was, as an old chronicle tells us, a
great jubilee. Bach composed his cantata, &lsquo;Ein&rsquo; feste
Burg,&rsquo; for the occasion. In this piece it is clear that
he had passed through his first phase of development
and reached a higher stage of perfection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Winterfeld is inclined to the same belief; but
Spitta, in his exhaustive biography of Bach, argues
that it must have been written either for the Reformation
Festival of 1730, or for the two hundredth
anniversary of Protestantism in Saxony, May 17,
1739. The former date would bring its composition
a year after the completion of his great Passions
music, and four years before his still more
famous &ldquo;Christmas Oratorio,&rdquo;&mdash;a period when he
was at the height of his productive power; which
favors the argument of Spitta, that in 1717 a chorus like the
opening one in the cantata was beyond his capacity.<sup><a id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a></sup>
In the year 1730 Bach wrote three
<span class="pb" id="pg_42">[42]</span>
Jubilee cantatas, rearranged from earlier works, and
Spitta claims that it was only about this period that
he resorted to this practice. Further, he adds that
&ldquo;the Chorale Chorus [the opening number], in
its grand proportions and vigorous flow, is the natural
and highest outcome of Bach&rsquo;s progressive
development, and he never wrote anything more
stupendous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cantata has eight numbers, three choruses
and five solos. The solo numbers are rearranged
from an earlier cantata, &ldquo;Alles was von Gott geboren&rdquo;
(&ldquo;All that is of God&rsquo;s creation&rdquo;), written for
the third Sunday in Lent, March 15, 1716. The opening
number is a colossal fugue based upon a variation
on the old melody and set to the first verse of
the Luther hymn. It is followed by a duet for soprano
and bass, including the second verse of the
hymn and an interpolated verse by Franck,<sup><a id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a></sup>
who prepared the text. The third and fourth numbers
are a bass recitative and soprano aria, the words
<span class="pb" id="pg_43">[43]</span>
also by Franck, leading up to the second great
chorale chorus set to the words of the third stanza
of the hymn,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And were the world all devils o&rsquo;er,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>of which Spitta says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The whole chorus sings the <i>Cantus firmus</i> in unison,
while the orchestra plays a whirl of grotesque and
wildly leaping figures, through which the chorus makes
its way undistracted and never misled, an illustration
of the third verse, as grandiose and characteristic as
it is possible to conceive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sixth number is a recitative for tenor followed
by a duet for alto and tenor (&ldquo;How blessed then are
they who still on God are calling&rdquo;). The work closes
with a repetition of the chorale, set to the last verse
of the hymn, sung without accompaniment. The
cantata is colossal in its proportions, and is characterized
throughout by the stirring spirit and bold
vigorous feeling of the Reformation days whose
memories it celebrated.</p>
<div class="fnblock">
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_8" href="#fr_8">[8]</a></sup> This
assumption, repeated by others, grows out of the similarity
of sentiment in the third stanza to that of Luther&rsquo;s famous
reply when he was urged not to attend the Diet of Worms.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_9" href="#fr_9">[9]</a></sup> There
is yet a fourth rearrangement, which we may assign to
1730. The assertion is no doubt well founded that in this year
the celebration of the Reformation Festival was considered of special
importance, and kept accordingly; and it is evident that the
cantata &ldquo;Ein&rsquo; feste Burg&rdquo; must have been intended for some such
extraordinary solemnity.&mdash;<i>Spitta</i>, vol. ii. p. 470.
<p class="fnp">The Reformation Festival had no doubt a very distinct poetical
sentiment of its own; and when any special occasion took the
precedence, as in 1730 and 1739, the years of Jubilee, it would be
misleading to seek for any close connection between the sermon
and the cantata. Thus the cantata, &ldquo;Ein&rsquo; feste Burg,&rdquo; may very
well have been connected with the sermon in 1730; still, it is possible
that it was not written till 1739.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i>, vol. iii. p. 283.</p>

<h3>BALFE.</h3>
<p>Michael William Balfe was born at
Dublin, Ireland, May 15, 1808. Of all the
English opera-composers, his career was
the most versatile, as his success, for a
time at least, was the most remarkable. At seven
years of age he scored a polacca of his own for a
band. In his eighth year he appeared as a violinist,
and in his tenth was composing ballads. At sixteen
he was playing in the Drury Lane orchestra,
and about this time began taking lessons in composition.
In 1825, aided by the generosity of a patron,
he went to Italy, where for three years he studied
singing and counterpoint. In his twentieth year he
met Rossini, who offered him an engagement as first
barytone at the Italian opera in Paris. He made
his d&eacute;but with success in 1828, and at the close of
his engagement returned to Italy, where he appeared
again on the stage. About this time (1829-1830)
he began writing Italian operas, and before he left
the country had produced three which met with considerable
success. In 1835 he returned to England;
and it was in this year that his first English opera,
<span class="pb" id="pg_45">[45]</span>
&ldquo;The Siege of Rochelle,&rdquo; was brought out. It was
played continuously at Drury Lane for over three
months. In 1835 appeared his &ldquo;Maid of Artois;&rdquo;
in 1837, &ldquo;Catharine Grey&rdquo; and &ldquo;Joan of Arc;&rdquo;
and in 1838, &ldquo;Falstaff.&rdquo; During these years he was
still singing in concerts and opera, and in 1840 undertook
the management of the Lyceum. His finest
works were produced after this date,&mdash;&ldquo;The Bohemian
Girl,&rdquo; in 1843; &ldquo;The Enchantress,&rdquo; in 1844;
&ldquo;The Rose of Castile,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Zingara,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Satanella,&rdquo;
in 1858; and &ldquo;The Puritan&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo; in
1861. His last opera was &ldquo;The Knight of the
Leopard,&rdquo; known in Italian as &ldquo;Il Talismano,&rdquo; which
has also been performed in English as &ldquo;The Talisman.&rdquo;
He married Mademoiselle Rosen, a German
singer, whom he met in Italy in 1835. His daughter
Victoire, who subsequently married Sir John Crampton,
and afterwards the Duc de Frias, also appeared
as a singer in 1856. Balfe died Oct. 20, 1870, upon
his own estate in Hertfordshire.</p>
</div>
<div id="c009" title="Mazeppa">
<h4>Mazeppa.</h4>
<p>The cantata of &ldquo;Mazeppa,&rdquo; the words written by
Jessica Rankin, was one of the last productions of
Balfe, having been produced in 1862, a year after
&ldquo;The Puritan&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; and several years after
he had passed his musical prime. The text is based
upon the familiar story as told by Byron in his poem
<span class="pb" id="pg_46">[46]</span>
of the wild ride of the page of King Casimir, &ldquo;The
Ukraine&rsquo;s hetman, calm and bold,&rdquo; and of the</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t6">&ldquo;noble steed,</p>
<p class="t0">A Tartar of the Ukraine breed,</p>
<p class="t0">Who looked as though the speed of thought</p>
<p class="t0">Was in his limbs.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The main incidents in the story&mdash;the guilty love of
the page Mazeppa for the Count Palatine&rsquo;s Theresa,
his surprise and seizure by the spies, her mysterious
fate, the wild flight of the steed with his wretched
load through forest and over desert, and the final
rescue by the Cossack maid&mdash;are preserved, but
liberties of every description are taken in the recital
of the narrative. It is but a feeble transcript
of Byron&rsquo;s glowing verse, and in its diluted form is
but a vulgar story of ordinary love, jealousy, and
revenge.</p>
<p>The cantata comprises twelve numbers. The first
is a prelude in triplets intended to picture the gallop
of the steed, a common enough device since the
days when Virgil did it much better without the aid
of musical notation, in his well-known line,&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It leads to a stirring chorus which is followed by
still another, based upon a very pleasant melody.
The third number is a solo for barytone, in which the
Count gives expression to his jealousy, which brings
us to the heroine, who makes her appearance in a
florid number. The next is a duet for Theresa and
<span class="pb" id="pg_47">[47]</span>
Mazeppa, followed by a solo for the tenor (Mazeppa)
which is very effective. The chorus then re-enter
and indicate the madness of the Count in words,
the following sample of which will show their unsingableness:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Revenge fires his turbulent soul;</p>
<p class="t0">No power his boundless rage can control.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The eighth number is another duet for the Countess
and Mazeppa in the conventional Italian style. It
is followed by a graceful aria for tenor, which leads
up to the best number in the work, a trio in canon
form. A final aria by the Count leads to the last
chorus, in which the repetition of the triplet gallop
forebodes the ride into the desert and the punishment
of the page. As might be inferred from the
description, the cantata is like Hamlet with <i>Hamlet</i>
left out. There is very little of Mazeppa and his
Tartar steed in the work, but very much of the jealousy
and revenge which lead up to the penalty.</p>

<h3>BEETHOVEN.</h3>
<p>Ludwig von Beethoven was born
Dec. 16, 1770, at Bonn, Germany. His
father was a court-singer in the Chapel
of the Elector of Cologne. The great
composer studied in Vienna with Haydn, with
whom he did not always agree, however, and afterwards
with Albrechtsberger. His first symphony
appeared in 1801,&mdash;his earlier symphonies, in what
is called his first period, being written in the Mozart
style. His only opera, &ldquo;Fidelio,&rdquo; for which he
wrote four overtures, was first brought out in Vienna,
in 1805; his oratorio, &ldquo;Christ on the Mount of
Olives,&rdquo; in 1812; and his colossal Ninth Symphony,
with its choral setting of Schiller&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ode to
Joy,&rdquo; in 1824. In addition to his symphonies, his
opera, oratorios, and masses, and the immortal series
of piano sonatas, which were almost revelations
in music, he developed chamber music to an extent
far beyond that reached by his predecessors, Mozart
and Haydn. His symphonies exhibit surprising
power, a marvellous comprehension of the deeper
feelings in life, and the influences of nature, both
<span class="pb" id="pg_49">[49]</span>
human and physical. He wrote with the deepest
earnestness, alike in the passion and the repose of
his music, and he invested it also with a genial humor
as well as with the highest expression of pathos.
His works are epic in style. He was the great
tone-poet of music. His subjects were always lofty
and dignified, and to their treatment he brought
not only a profound knowledge of musical technicality,
but intense sympathy with the innermost feelings
of human nature, for he was a humanitarian
in the broadest sense. By the common consent of
the musical world he stands at the head of all composers
since his time, and has always been their
guide and inspiration. He died March 26, 1827,
in the midst of a raging thunder-storm,&mdash;one of his
latest utterances being a recognition of the &ldquo;divine
spark&rdquo; in Schubert&rsquo;s music.</p>

<div id="c011" title="The Ruins of Athens">
<h4>The Ruins of Athens.</h4>
<p>The most important compositions by Beethoven
in 1811 were the music to two dramatic works
written by the poet Kotzebue to celebrate the
opening of the new theatre at Pesth, Hungary.
One of these was a prologue in one act with
overture and choruses, entitled &ldquo;K&ouml;nig Stephan,<sup><a id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></sup>
Ungarn&rsquo;s erster Wohlth&auml;ter&rdquo; (&ldquo;King Stephen,
Hungary&rsquo;s first Benefactor&rdquo;); the other, an allegorical
<span class="pb" id="pg_50">[50]</span>
sketch, called &ldquo;The Ruins of Athens,&rdquo;
the subject of which is thus concisely stated by
Macfarren:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Minerva has been since the golden age of Grecian
art, the glorious epoch of Grecian liberty, for some or
other important offence against the Olympian tribunal,
the particulars of which I am unable to furnish, fettered
with chains of heaven-wrought adamant by the
omnipotent thunderer within a rock impenetrable alike
to the aspirations of man and to the intelligence of the
goddess, a rock through which neither his spirit of inquiry
could approach, nor her wisdom diffuse itself
upon the world. The period of vengeance is past;
Jove relents, and the captive deity is enfranchised.
The first steps of her freedom naturally lead Minerva
to the scene of her ancient greatness. She finds
Athens, her Athens, her especially beloved and
most carefully cherished city, in ruins, the descendants
of her fostered people enslaved to a barbarous
and fanatic race; the trophies of her former splendor,
the wrecks of that art which is the example and the
regret of all time, appropriated to the most degrading
purposes of vulgar householdry; and the frenzied worshippers
of a faith that knows not the divine presence
in its most marvellous manifestation, the intellect of
man. Here is no longer the home of wisdom and the
arts; so the liberated goddess proceeds to Pesth, where
she establishes anew her temple in the new theatre,
and presides over a triumphal procession in honor of
the Emperor, its patron, under whose auspices the
golden age is to prevail again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the opening performances the music to
&ldquo;King Stephen&rdquo; was laid aside until 1841, when
<span class="pb" id="pg_51">[51]</span>
it was given in Vienna; but the after-piece, &ldquo;The
Ruins of Athens,&rdquo; was presented again during
Beethoven&rsquo;s lifetime upon the occasion of the
opening of a theatre in that city. The new text,
which was prepared for it by Carl Meisl, was entitled
&ldquo;Die Weihe des Hauses&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Dedication
of the House&rdquo;), and Beethoven wrote for
it the overture which is now so famous, solos
for soprano and violin, and a final chorus with
dances.</p>
<p>The music to the &ldquo;Ruins of Athens&rdquo; comprises
eight numbers. The overture is very light and unpretentious,
and by many critics, among them Ferdinand
Ries, Beethoven&rsquo;s pupil, has been deemed
unworthy of the composer. Thayer says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;When the overture was first played at Leipsic,
people could hardly trust their ears, could hardly believe
it to be the work of the author of the symphonies,
of the overtures to &lsquo;Coriolan,&rsquo; &lsquo;Egmont,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Leonore&rsquo; (Fidelio).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opening number is a chorus (&ldquo;Daughter
of mighty Jove, awake!&rdquo;), which is followed by a
beautiful duet (&ldquo;Faultless, yet hated&rdquo;), voicing the
lament of two Greek slaves for the destruction of
their temples and the degradation of their land. The
duet is very pathetic in character, and the melody,
carried by the two voices, leaves an impression of
sadness which cannot be resisted. The third number
is the well-known chorus of Dervishes sung in
unison by tenors and basses, thus forming a kind of
<span class="pb" id="pg_52">[52]</span>
choral chant. The melody is a weird one, and full
of local color, but its powerful effect is gained by the
manner of treatment. It begins pianissimo and is
gradually worked to the extreme pitch of true Dervish
delirium, culminating in the exclamation, &ldquo;Great
Prophet, hail!&rdquo; and then gradually subsiding until it
dies away, apparently from the exhaustion of such
fervor. It is followed by the familiar Turkish march,
founded on the theme of the Variations in D, op. 76,
very simple in construction, Oriental in its character
throughout, and peculiarly picturesque in effect. After
an instrumental movement behind the scenes, a triumphal
march and chorus (&ldquo;Twine ye a Garland&rdquo;)
is introduced. The seventh number is a recitative
and aria by the high priest with chorus, which
lead to a beautifully melodious chorus (&ldquo;Susceptible
Hearts&rdquo;). An adagio aria for bass (&ldquo;Deign, great
Apollo&rdquo;) and a vigorous chorus (&ldquo;Hail, our
King&rdquo;) bring the work to a close. The piece
was first brought out in England by Mendelssohn
in 1844 at one of the Philharmonic Society&rsquo;s concerts;
and ten or twelve years later an English version
of it was performed at the Prince&rsquo;s Theatre,
when the Royal Exchange and statue of Wellington
were substituted for the Pesth Theatre, and Shakspeare
took the place of the Emperor of Austria,
concerning the good taste of which Macfarren
pithily says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Modifications admirably adapted to the commercial
character and the blind vainglory that so eminently
mark the British nation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="fnblock">
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_11" href="#fr_11">[11]</a></sup> Born in the year 977 at Gran, and known in Austrian and
Hungarian history as Saint Stephen.

<div id="c012" title="The Glorious Moment">
<div class="pb" id="pg_53">[53]</div>
<h4>The Glorious Moment.</h4>
<p>In September, 1814, the same year in which the
Allies entered Paris, the Vienna Congress met to
adjust the relations of the various European States.
It was an occasion of great moment in the ancient
city,&mdash;this gathering of sovereigns and distinguished
statesmen,&mdash;and the magistracy prepared
themselves to celebrate it with befitting pomp and
ceremony. Beethoven was requested to set a poem,
written by Dr. Aloys Weissenbach, of Salzburg, in
cantata form, which was to be sung as a greeting
to the royal visitors. It was &ldquo;Der glorreiche
Augenblick,&rdquo; sometimes written &ldquo;Der heilige Augenblick&rdquo;
(&ldquo;The Glorious Moment&rdquo;). The time
for its composition was very brief, and was made
still shorter by the quarrels the composer had with
the poet in trying to reduce the barbarous text to a
more inspiring and musical form. He began the
composition in September, and it was first performed
on the 29th of the following November,
together with the &ldquo;Battle of Vittoria,&rdquo; and the A
major (Seventh) symphony, written in the previous
year. The concert took place in the presence of
the sovereigns and an immense audience which received
his works with every demonstration of enthusiasm,
particularly &ldquo;The Glorious Moment,&rdquo;&mdash;a
moment which all hailed as the precursor of a
happier epoch for Europe, soon to be freed from
Napoleonic oppression. The occasion was one of
<span class="pb" id="pg_54">[54]</span>
great benefit to the composer at a time when he
was sorely in need of assistance. The distinguished
foreign visitors thronged the salon of the Archduke
Rudolph to pay him homage. Handsome gifts
were lavished upon him so that he was enabled to
make a permanent investment of 20,000 marks in
shares of the bank of Austria. Brilliant entertainments
were given by the Russian ambassador,
Prince Rasoumowsky,<sup><a id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></sup>
in his palace, at one of
which Beethoven was presented to the sovereigns.
The Empress of Russia also gave him a reception and
made him magnificent presents. Schindler says:</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Not without feeling did the great master afterwards
recall those days in the Imperial Palace and that of
the Russian Prince; and once with a certain pride remarked
that he had allowed the crowned heads to pay
court to him, and that he had carried himself thereby
proudly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stern old republican, however, who could
rebuke Goethe for taking off his hat in the presence
of royalty, spoke such sentiments jocosely. He expresses
his real feelings in a letter written to the
attorney, Herr J. Kauka, of Prague:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I write nothing about our monarchs and monarchies,
for the newspapers give you every information
on these subjects. The intellectual realm is the most
precious in my eyes, and far above all temporal and
spiritual monarchies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_55">[55]</div>
<p>The cantata itself, while not one of the most
meritorious of the composer&rsquo;s works, for reasons
which are sufficiently apparent, still is very effective
in its choruses. The detailed parts do not need
special description; they are six in number, as follows:
No. 1, chorus (&ldquo;Europa steht&rdquo;); No. 2,
recitative and chorus (&ldquo;O, seht sie nah und n&auml;her
treten&rdquo;); No. 3, grand scena, soprano, with violin
obligato and chorus (&ldquo;O Himmel, welch&rsquo; Entz&uuml;cken&rdquo;);
No. 4, soprano solo and chorus (&ldquo;Das
Auge schaut&rdquo;); No. 5, recitative and quartet for
two sopranos, tenor, and bass (&ldquo;Der den Bund im
Sturme festgehalten&rdquo;); No. 6, chorus and fugue
(&ldquo;Es treten hervor die Scharen der Frauen&rdquo;), closing
with a stirring &ldquo;Heil und Gluck&rdquo; to Vindobona,
the ancient name of the city. In 1836, nine years
after the composer&rsquo;s death, the cantata appeared
with a new poetical setting by Friedrich Rochlitz,
under the title of &ldquo;Preis der Tonkunst&rdquo; (&ldquo;Praise
of Music&rdquo;), in which form it was better adapted
for general performance.</p>
<p>Among other compositions of Beethoven which
assimilate to the cantata form, are Op. 112, &ldquo;Meeresstille
und gl&uuml;ckliche Fahrt,&rdquo; for four voices, with
orchestra accompaniment; Op. 121, &ldquo;Opferlied,&rdquo;
for soprano solo, with chorus and orchestra accompaniment;
and Op. 122, &ldquo;Bundeslied,&rdquo; for two
solo voices, three-part chorus, and accompaniment
of two clarinets, two bassoons, and two horns.</p>
<div class="fnblock">
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_12" href="#fr_12">[12]</a></sup> Prince Rasoumowsky, who was the Russian ambassador at the
Austrian Court for twenty years, was himself a thorough musician,
and ranked as one of the best players in Vienna, of the Haydn and
Beethoven quartets. His instrument was the second violin.

<h3>BENEDICT.</h3>
<p>Sir Julius Benedict, whose name is
so intimately connected with music in
England, was born at Stuttgart, Nov. 27,
1804. After a short period of study with
Hummel at Weimar he became a pupil of Weber.
He progressed so rapidly that at the age of nineteen
he conducted operatic performances in Vienna, and
a few years afterwards was leader at the San Carlo in
Naples, where he produced his first opera, &ldquo;Giacinta
ed Ernesto.&rdquo; In 1835 he went to Paris and thence
to London, where he remained until his death. In
1836 he led the orchestra at the Lyceum Theatre,
and was also conductor at Drury Lane during the
memorable seasons in which the best of Balfe&rsquo;s operas
were brought out. It was during this period also
that he produced two of his own operas,&mdash;&ldquo;The
Brides of Venice&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Crusaders,&rdquo; which
are ranked among his best works of this class. In
1850 he accompanied Jenny Lind on her memorable
tour through this country. On his return to
England he was engaged as conductor at Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre, and afterwards at Drury Lane.
<span class="pb" id="pg_57">[57]</span>
In 1860 he produced the cantata of &ldquo;Undine;&rdquo; in
1862 the opera &ldquo;Lily of Killarney;&rdquo; in 1863 the
cantata &ldquo;Richard C&oelig;ur de Leon;&rdquo; in 1864 the
operetta &ldquo;Bride of Song;&rdquo; in 1866 the cantata
&ldquo;St. Cecilia;&rdquo; and in 1870 the oratorio &ldquo;St. Peter.&rdquo;
In 1871 he received the honor of knighthood, and
in 1873 brought out a symphony which met with
great success. In 1874, the occasion of his seventieth
birthday, he was made Knight Commander of
the orders of Francis and Joseph and of Frederic,
Austrian and Wurtembergian decorations. Nearly
every sovereign in Europe had thus honored him.
He was also conductor of the London Monday
Popular Concerts for many years, and directed
many chamber concerts. He died full of honors
in June, 1885.</p>
</div>
<div id="c014" title="St. Cecilia">
<h4>St. Cecilia.</h4>
<p>The legend of St. Cecilia for two centuries has inspired
the poet and composer, and the custom of
celebrating her festival has obtained in nearly all
European countries during the same period. The
earliest observance was at Evreux, France, in 1571.
The first celebration in England of which any record
remains was that of 1683; though it is clear from the
accounts of musical writers in the seventeenth century
that the custom had been practised many years
prior to that date. From 1683 to 1750 St. Cecilia
festivals were given annually in London, and for
these occasions an ode was written and set to music.<sup><a id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></sup>
<span class="pb" id="pg_58">[58]</span>
In the latter year the distinctive name of the
festival fell into disuse, though large musical festivals
were frequently held after that year on the
saint&rsquo;s day. In France regular entertainments were
given on St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Day from 1573 to 1601,
when the record terminates. In Italy the anniversary
of the saint has not been celebrated except as
a church festival. In Germany the custom prevailed
as early as the sixteenth century; and in the next
century Cecilia festivals were quite common in
Spain. Prior to Benedict&rsquo;s work the most modern
composition having the legend for its basis was
a cantata by Van Bree, of Amsterdam, written in
1845.</p>
<p>These preliminaries will enable the reader the
better to understand the introduction which Mr.
Chorley has written to the text of the cantata by
Benedict, composed for the Norwich Festival of
1866. Mr. Chorley says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;It has long been a favorite fancy of mine to treat
the legend of St. Cecilia for music with a view to
the possible revival of such celebrations as were held
<span class="pb" id="pg_59">[59]</span>
in gone-by years, when English sympathy for the art
was more limited in every respect than at the present
time. It is true that the names of Dryden and Addison
among the poets, and of Handel among the musicians,
who have made &lsquo;divine Cecilia&rsquo;s&rsquo; praise immortal, might
be thought to deter anyone from dealing with the subject.
But theirs were merely votive odes indirectly bearing
on the power of the art of which Cecilia is patron
saint. This cantata of mine sets forth her story, which,
so far as I am aware, has not been done before in any
of the works produced for the Cecilian festivals in England.
All who are familiar with the accepted legend,
as told in the &lsquo;Legenda Aurea&rsquo; of Jacobus Januensis,
Archbishop of Genoa, will perceive that I have treated
it with a certain liberty. Some of the minor incidents&mdash;such
as the conversion and martyrdom of Tiburtius,
the brother of Valerianus&mdash;have been omitted with a
view of avoiding the introduction of secondary persons,
and of concentrating the main interest in the martyr
heroine. Further, the catastrophe which (to cite
Dryden&rsquo;s known line in defiance of its original
import)</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Raised a mortal to the skies,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="bq">has been simplified. The legend narrates that after
the agony of slow fire, which failed to kill the Christian
bride, the sword ended her days. A literal adherence
to this tradition might have weakened the closing
scene by presenting two situations of the same character.
Others must judge how far I have been
indiscreet, or the reverse, in its omission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story of the cantata is strikingly similar to
that which forms the theme of Donizetti&rsquo;s opera
&ldquo;Il Poliuto,&rdquo; though the manner of the conversions
<span class="pb" id="pg_60">[60]</span>
differs. In the former it is Valerianus, the lover of
Cecilia, who is turned from heathenism by the angelic
vision. In the latter it is Paulina, the wife of
the Roman convert Polyutus, who witnesses the divine
illumination and hears the celestial harps, which
induce her to abjure the worship of the gods and
join her husband in martyrdom. It is in fact the
old, old story of the persecutions of a new faith
by the old. Cecilia, though married to Valerianus,
hears the divine call summoning the bride away
from her lover until he shall have been converted.
She appeals to Heaven in his behalf. A vision of
angels appears to him and their songs win his soul.
The infuriated prefect, who has but just performed
the rites of their marriage, orders their death,&mdash;Valerianus
to be beheaded, and Cecilia to die by the
slow martyrdom of fire. The tragedy of the former
is left to the imagination. Cecilia dies surrounded
by the angels and hears their voices:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Before mine eyes, already dim,</p>
<p class="t">Doth heaven unclose the gate;</p>
<p class="t0">I hear the choiring seraphim</p>
<p class="t">Around the throne that wait.</p>
<p class="t0">To join the song of that bright choir</p>
<p class="t">Thy mercy sets me free;</p>
<p class="t0">And so I triumph o&rsquo;er the fire,</p>
<p class="t">And rise, O Lord, to Thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The work contains thirteen numbers, and the solos
are divided as follows: Cecilia, soprano; Valerianus,
tenor; the Prefect of Rome, bass; a Christian woman,
contralto. The remaining numbers are assigned
to choruses of Roman citizens, Christians, and angels.
<span class="pb" id="pg_61">[61]</span>
A tender and sorrowful prelude, foreshadowing the
tragedy, introduces a bright and joyous wedding
chorus (&ldquo;Let the Lutes play their loudest&rdquo;), which
in its middle part is divided between male and female
choir, returning to four-part harmony in the close.
The next number is an ecstatic love-song for Valerianus
(&ldquo;The Love too deep for Words to speak&rdquo;),
which leads up to a scena and duet for Valerianus
and Cecilia (&ldquo;O my Lord, if I must grieve you&rdquo;),
which is very dramatic in its texture. The conversion
music, including an obligato soprano solo with
chorus of angels (&ldquo;Praise the Lord&rdquo;), recitative and
air for tenor with choral responses (&ldquo;Cease not, I
pray you&rdquo;), and an animated chorus of angels
(&ldquo;From our Home&rdquo;), follows, and closes the first
part.</p>
<p>The second part opens with the curse of the prefect,
a very passionate aria for bass (&ldquo;What mean
these Zealots vile?&rdquo;), following which in marked contrast
is a lovely aria for contralto (&ldquo;Father, whose
Blessing we entreat&rdquo;). The next number, a quartet
with full choral accompaniment (&ldquo;God is our Hope
and Strength&rdquo;), is one of the most effective in the
work, and is followed by the trial scene, a duet between
Valerianus and the prefect, the latter accompanied
by chorus. A short funeral march intervenes.
Valerianus and Cecilia bid each other farewell; the
former is borne away, and Cecilia sings her dying
song (&ldquo;Those whom the Highest One befriends&rdquo;)
amid the triumphant hallelujahs of the angels.</p>

<h3>BENNETT.</h3>
<p>William Sterndale Bennett, one
of the most gifted and individual of English
composers, was born at Sheffield,
April 13, 1816. His musical genius displayed
itself early, and in his tenth year he was
placed in the Royal Academy of Music, of which in
his later years he became principal. He received
his early instruction in composition from Lucas
and Dr. Crotch, and studied the piano with Cipriani
Potter, who had been a pupil of Mozart. The first
composition which gained him distinction was the
Concerto in D minor, written in 1832, which was
followed by the Capriccio in D minor. During the
next three years he produced the overture to &ldquo;Parisina,&rdquo;
the F minor Concerto, and the &ldquo;Na&iuml;ades&rdquo;
overture, the success of which was so great that a
prominent musical house in London offered to send
him to Leipsic for a year. He went there, and
soon won his way to the friendship of Schumann
and Mendelssohn. With the latter he was on very
intimate terms, which has led to the erroneous statement
that he was his pupil. In 1840 he made a
<span class="pb" id="pg_63">[63]</span>
second visit to Leipsic, where he composed his
Caprice in E, and the &ldquo;Wood Nymphs&rdquo; overture.
In 1842 he returned to England, and for several
years was busily engaged with chamber concerts.
In 1849 he founded the Bach Society, arranged the
&ldquo;Matthew Passion&rdquo; music of that composer, as
well as his &ldquo;Christmas Oratorio,&rdquo; and brought out
the former work in 1854. The previous year he
was offered the distinguished honor of the conductorship
of the Gewandhaus concerts at Leipsic, but
did not accept. In 1856 he was appointed conductor
of the Philharmonic Society, and filled the
position for ten years, resigning it to take the head
of the Royal Academy of Music. In the same year
he was elected musical professor at Cambridge,
where he received the degree of Doctor of Music
and other honors. In 1858 his beautiful cantata
&ldquo;The May Queen&rdquo; was produced at the Leeds
Festival, and in 1862 the &ldquo;Paradise and the Peri&rdquo;
overture, written for the Philharmonic Society. In
1867 his oratorio, or, as he modestly terms it,
&ldquo;sacred cantata,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Woman of Samaria,&rdquo; was
produced with great success at the Birmingham
Festival. In 1870 he was honored with a degree
by the University of Oxford, and a year later received
the empty distinction of knighthood. His
last public appearance was at a festival in Brighton
in 1874, where he conducted his &ldquo;Woman of Samaria.&rdquo;
He died Feb. 1, 1875, and was buried in
Westminster Abbey with distinguished honors.</p>

<div id="c016" title="The May Queen">
<div class="pb" id="pg_64">[64]</div>
<h4>The May Queen.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The May Queen,&rdquo; a pastoral cantata, the libretto
by Henry F. Chorley, was first performed at
the Leeds Festival of 1858. The solo parts are
written for the May Queen (soprano); the Queen
(contralto); the Lover (tenor); and the Captain
of the Foresters, as Robin Hood (bass). The
opening scene pictures the dressing of the tree for
the spring festivity on the banks of the Thames,
and the preparations for the reception of the May
Queen. A despondent lover enters and sings his
melancholy plight as he reflects upon the fickleness
of the May Queen, interrupted at intervals by the
merry shouts of the chorus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;With a laugh as we go round</p>
<p class="t0">To the merry, merry sound</p>
<p class="t0">Of the tabor and the pipe,</p>
<p class="t">We will frolic on the green;</p>
<p class="t0">For since the world began,</p>
<p class="t0">And our royal river ran,</p>
<p class="t0">Was never such a May Day,</p>
<p class="t">And never such a Queen.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The lover continues his doleful lamenting, which
is at last interrupted by the entrance of the May
Queen herself, who chides him for his complaints
and argues her right to coquet on such a day. As
their interview closes, a band of foresters enter with
their greenwood king, Robin Hood, at their head,
who after a rollicking hunting-song makes open
love to the May Queen. The enraged lover resents
<span class="pb" id="pg_65">[65]</span>
his impertinence, and at last strikes him a blow,
which by the laws exposes him to the loss of his
hand. Before he can make his escape there is a
flourish of trumpets, and the Queen enters and
demands the reason for the brawl. The revellers
inform her that the lover has struck the forester.
She orders his arrest, whereupon the May Queen
intercedes with her for her lover&rsquo;s release and declares
her affection for him. Her appeal for mercy
is granted. The forester is banished from the royal
presence for lowering himself to the level of a peasant
girl, the May Queen is ordered to wed her lover
on the coming morn, and all ends happily with the
joyous chorus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And the cloud hath passed away,</p>
<p class="t0">That was heavy on the May;</p>
<p class="t0">And the river floweth fair,</p>
<p class="t">And the meadow bloometh green.</p>
<p class="t0">They embrace, no more to part,</p>
<p class="t0">While we sing from every heart,</p>
<p class="t">A blessing on the bridal!</p>
<p class="t">A blessing on the Queen!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The music of the cantata is divided into ten
numbers, which are characterized by exquisite refinement
and artistic taste. The solos, particularly
No. 2, for tenor (&ldquo;O Meadow, clad in early
Green&rdquo;), No. 4, the obligato soprano (&ldquo;With the
Carol in the Tree&rdquo;), and No. 6, the forester&rsquo;s
lusty greenwood song (&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis jolly to hunt in the
bright Moonlight&rdquo;), are very melodious, and well
adapted to the individual characters. The concerted
music is written in the most scholarly manner,
<span class="pb" id="pg_66">[66]</span>
the choruses are full of life and spirit, and the
instrumentation is always effective. There are few
more beautiful cantatas than &ldquo;The May Queen,&rdquo;
though the composer was hampered by a dull and
not very inspiring libretto. Poor words, however,
could not affect his delightful grace and fancy,
which manifest themselves in every number of this
little pastoral. It is surprising that so excellent a
work, and one which is so well adapted to chorus
singing and solo display, without making very severe
demands upon the singers, is not more frequently
given in this country.</p>
</div>
<div id="c017" title="The Exhibition Ode">
<h4>The Exhibition Ode.</h4>
<p>The music for the opening of the International
Exhibition at London, which occurred in May, 1862,
was of unusual excellence. Auber sent a composition
which, though called a march, was in reality a
brilliant overture. Meyerbeer contributed an overture
in march form, in which three marches were
blended in one, the whole culminating in &ldquo;Rule
Britannia.&rdquo; Verdi wrote a cantata, which was rejected
by the Commissioners because by the side
of the national anthem he had introduced the revolutionary
Marseillaise and the Italian war-song
called &ldquo;Garibaldienne.&rdquo; Its rejection not only
caused great indignation in the musical world, but
at once made it famous; and it was afterwards
publicly performed, Mademoiselle Titiens taking the
soprano solos, Sir Julius Benedict conducting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_67">[67]</div>
<p>The prominent feature of the musical programme,
however, was the Ode which the poet laureate and
Bennett conjointly furnished. Never before were
Mr. Tennyson&rsquo;s verses more completely united with
music. The work is divided into three parts, all
choral, linked by recitatives. The first number is
a hymn to the Deity (&ldquo;Uplift a thousand Voices
full and sweet&rdquo;), written as a four-part chorale,
which is very jubilant in style. The next movement,&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O silent father of our kings to be,</p>
<p class="t0">Mourned in this golden hour of jubilee,</p>
<p class="t0">For this, for all, we weep our thanks to thee,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>eloquently referring to the Prince Consort, is set
in the minor key, and is one of the most pathetic
musical passages ever written. Then follows a descriptive
catalogue of the industries represented,&mdash;&ldquo;harvest
tool and husbandry,&rdquo; &ldquo;loom and wheel
and engin&rsquo;ry,&rdquo; and so on, through which the music
labors some, as might have been expected; but
in the close it once more resumes its melodious
flow, leading up to the final chorus, in which the
theme of the opening chorale is borrowed and developed
with peculiar originality and artistic skill
into a movement of great richness in effects and
beauty in expression. It is unfortunate for the
popularity of such an excellent work that it was
composed for a special occasion.</p>

<div id="c018" title="Berlioz">
<div class="pb" id="pg_68">[68]</div>
<div class="img"><img src="images/p068.png" alt="" width="366" height="80" /></div>
<h3>BERLIOZ.</h3>
<p>Hector Berlioz, one of the most renowned
of modern French composers,
and an acute critic and skilful conductor
as well, was born, Dec. 11, 1803, at La
C&ocirc;te St. Andr&eacute;, in France. His father was a physician,
and intended him for the same profession.
He reluctantly went to Paris and began the study
of medicine; but music became his engrossing passion,
and medicine was abandoned. He entered
the Conservatory as a pupil of Lesueur, and soon
showed himself superior to all his masters except
Cherubini, which aroused a strong opposition to
him and his compositions. It was only after repeated
trials that he took the first prize, which
entitled him to go to Italy for three years. On his
return to Paris he encountered renewed antipathy.
His music was not well received, and he was obliged
to support himself by conducting at concerts and
writing articles for the press. As a final resort he
organized a concert-tour through Germany and
Russia, the details of which are contained in his
extremely interesting Autobiography. At these
concerts his own music was the staple of the programmes,
<span class="pb" id="pg_69">[69]</span>
and it met with great success, though not
always played by the best of orchestras, and not
always well by the best, as his own testimony shows;
for his compositions are very exacting, and call for
every resource known to the modern orchestra.
The Germans were quick in appreciating his music;
but it was not until after his death that his ability
was conceded in France. In 1839 he was appointed
librarian of the Conservatory, and in 1856
was made a member of the French Academy.
These were the only honors he received, though he
long sought to obtain a professorship in the Conservatory.
A romantic but sad incident in his life
was his violent passion for Miss Smithson, an Irish
actress, whom he saw upon the Paris stage in the
<i>r&ocirc;le</i> of Ophelia, at a time when Victor Hugo had
revived an admiration for Shakspeare among the
French. He married her, but did not live with her
long, owing to her bad temper and ungovernable
jealousy; though after the separation he honorably
contributed to her support out of the pittance he
was earning. Among his great works are the opera,
&ldquo;Benvenuto Cellini;&rdquo; the symphony with chorus,
&ldquo;Romeo and Juliet;&rdquo; &ldquo;Beatrice and Benedict;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Les Troyens,&rdquo; the text from Virgil&rsquo;s &ldquo;&AElig;neid;&rdquo;
the symphony, &ldquo;Harold in Italy;&rdquo; the symphony,
&ldquo;Fun&egrave;bre et Triomphe;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Damnation of
Faust;&rdquo; a double-chorused &ldquo;Te Deum;&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Symphony Fantastique;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Requiem;&rdquo; and
the sacred trilogy, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Enfance du Christ.&rdquo; Berlioz
stands among all other composers as the foremost
<span class="pb" id="pg_70">[70]</span>
representative of &ldquo;programme music,&rdquo; and
has left explicit and very detailed explanations of
the meaning of his works, so that the hearer may
listen intelligently by seeing the external objects his
music is intended to picture. In the knowledge of
individual instruments and the grouping of them
for effect, in warmth of imagination and brilliancy
of color, and in his daring combinations and fantastic
moods, which are sometimes carried to the
very verge of eccentricity, he is a colossus among
modern musicians. He died in Paris, March 8,
1869.</p>
</div>
<div id="c019" title="Romeo and Juliet">
<h4>Romeo and Juliet.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Dramatic symphony, with choruses, solos, chant,
and prologue in choral recitative&rdquo; is the title which
Berlioz gives to his &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rdquo; It was
written in 1839, and its composition commemorates
an interesting episode in his career. In the previous
year he had written his symphony &ldquo;Harold
in Italy,&rdquo; the subject inspired by Byron&rsquo;s &ldquo;Childe
Harold.&rdquo; Paganini, the wonder of the musical
world at that time, was present at its performance,
and was so pleased with the work that he sent Berlioz
an enthusiastic tribute of applause as well as of
substantial remembrance.<sup><a id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></sup>
The composer at that
<span class="pb" id="pg_71">[71]</span>
time was in straitened circumstances, and in his
gratitude for this timely relief he resolved to write
a work which should be worthy of dedication to the
great violinist. His Autobiography bears ample
testimony to the enthusiasm with which he worked.
He says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;At last, after much indecision, I hit upon the idea
of a symphony, with choruses, vocal solos, and choral
recitatives, on the sublime and ever novel theme of
Shakspeare&rsquo;s &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rsquo; I wrote in prose all
the text intended for the vocal pieces which came between
the instrumental selections. &Eacute;mile Deschamps,
with his usual delightful good-nature and marvellous
facility, set it to verse for me, and I began....</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;During all that time how ardently did I live!
How vigorously I struck out on that grand sea of
poetry caressed by the playful breeze of fancy, beneath
the hot rays of that sun of love which Shakspeare
kindled, always confident of my power to reach the
marvellous island where stands the temple of true
art! Whether I succeeded or not it is not for me to
decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work opens with a fiery introduction representing
the combats and tumults of the two rival
houses of Capulet and Montague, and the intervention
of the Prince. It is followed by a choral
recitative for four altos, tenors, and basses (&ldquo;Long
smouldering Hatreds&rdquo;), with which is interwoven a
contralto solo (&ldquo;Romeo too is there&rdquo;), the number
closing with a passionate chorus (&ldquo;The Revels now
are o&rsquo;er&rdquo;). A beautiful effect is made at this point
by assigning to the alto voice two couplets (&ldquo;Joys
<span class="pb" id="pg_72">[72]</span>
of first Love&rdquo;) which are serious in style but very
rich in melody. A brief bit of choral recitative
and a few measures for tenor&mdash;Mercutio&rsquo;s raillery&mdash;lead
up to a dainty scherzetto for tenor solo and
small chorus (&ldquo;Mab! bright Elf of Dreamland&rdquo;),
and a short choral passage brings this scene to a
close.</p>
<p>The second scene, which is for orchestra only,
an impressive declamatory phrase developing into a
tender melody, representing the sadness of Romeo,
set in tones against the brilliant dance music in the
distance accompanying the revel of the Capulets, is
one of the most striking effects Berlioz has accomplished,
and illustrates his astonishing command of
instrumentation. The third scene represents Capulet&rsquo;s
garden in the stillness of night, the young
Capulets passing through it, bidding each other adieu
and repeating snatches of the dance music. As
their strains die away in the distance the balcony
scene between Romeo and Juliet is given by the
orchestra alone in a genuine love-poem full of passion
and sensuousness. No words could rival the
impassioned beauty of this melodious number. The
fourth scene is also given to the orchestra, and is
a setting of Mercutio&rsquo;s description of Queen Mab.
It is a scherzo intensely swift in its movement and
almost ethereal in its dainty, graceful rhythm. The
instrumentation is full of subtle effects, particularly
in the romantic passages for the horns.</p>
<p>In the fifth scene we pass from the tripping
music of the fairies to the notes of woe. It describes
<span class="pb" id="pg_73">[73]</span>
the funeral procession of Juliet, beginning
with a solemn march in fugue style, at first instrumental,
with occasional entrances of the voices in
monotone, and then vocal (&ldquo;O mourn, O mourn,
strew choicest Flowers&rdquo;), the monotone being assigned
to the instruments. It preludes a powerful
orchestral scene representing Romeo&rsquo;s invocation,
Juliet&rsquo;s awakening, and the despair and death of
the lovers.<sup><a id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a></sup>
The finale is mainly for double chorus,
representing the quarrel between the Montagues
and Capulets in the cemetery, which is written with
great dramatic power and conceived on the large
scale of an operatic <i>ensemble</i> both in the voice
parts and instrumentation, and the final reconciliation
through the intercession of Friar Laurence,
whose declamatory solos are very striking, particularly
the air, &ldquo;Poor Children mine, let me
mourn you.&rdquo; The work is one of almost colossal
difficulty, and requires great artists, singers and
players, to give expression to its daring realism.
Among all of Berlioz&rsquo;s programme-music, this tone-picture
of the principal episodes in Shakspeare&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="pg_74">[74]</span>
tragedy stands out clear and sharp by virtue of its
astonishing dramatic power.</p>

pieces which are addressed solely to the imagination have no
public. The following instrumental scene is in this case, and I
think it should be omitted whenever this symphony is given before
an audience not having a feeling for poetry, and not familiar with
the fifth act of Shakspeare&rsquo;s tragedy. This implies its omission
ninety-nine times out of a hundred. It presents, moreover, immense
difficulties of execution. Consequently, after Juliet&rsquo;s funeral procession
a moment of silence should be observed, then the finale
should be taken up.

<div id="c020" title="The Damnation of Faust">
<h4>The Damnation of Faust.</h4>
<p>The &ldquo;Damnation of Faust,&rdquo; dramatic legend, as
Berlioz calls it, was written in 1846. It is divided
in four parts, the first containing three, the second
four, the third six, and the fourth five scenes, the
last concluding with an epilogue and the apotheosis
of Marguerite. It was first produced in Paris in
November, 1846, and had its first hearing in this
country Feb. 12, 1880, when the late Dr. Leopold
Damrosch brought it out with the assistance of
the New York Symphony, Oratorio, and Arion
Societies.</p>
<p>Berlioz has left in his Autobiography an extremely
interesting account of the manner in which he composed
it. Though he had had the plan of the
work in his mind for many years, it was not until
1846 that he began the legend. During this
year he was travelling on a concert-tour through
Austria, Hungary, Bohemia, and Silesia, and the different
numbers were written at intervals of leisure.
He says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I wrote when I could and where I could; in the
coach, on the railroad, in steamboats, and even in
towns, notwithstanding the various cares entailed by
my concerts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began with Faust&rsquo;s invocation to Nature,
which was finished &ldquo;in my old German post-chaise.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="pg_75">[75]</span>
The introduction was written in an inn
at Passau, and at Vienna he finished up the Elbe
scene, Mephistopheles&rsquo; song, and the exquisite
Sylph&rsquo;s ballet. As to the introduction of the R&aacute;k&oacute;czy
march, his words deserve quoting in this
connection, as they throw some light on the general
character of the work. He says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I have already mentioned my writing a march at
Vienna, in one night, on the Hungarian air of R&aacute;k&oacute;czy.
The extraordinary effect it produced at Pesth made
me resolve to introduce it in Faust, by taking the
liberty of placing my hero in Hungary at the opening
of the act, and making him present at the march of a
Hungarian army across the plain. A German critic
considered it most extraordinary in me to have made
Faust travel in such a place. I do not see why, and
I should not have hesitated in the least to bring him
in in any other direction if it would have benefited the
piece. I had not bound myself to follow Goethe&rsquo;s
plot, and the most eccentric travels may be attributed
to such a personage as Faust without transgressing
the bounds of possibility. Other German critics took
up the same thesis, and attacked me with even greater
violence about my modifications of Goethe&rsquo;s text and
plot; just as though there were no other Faust but
Goethe&rsquo;s, and as if it were possible to set the whole of
such a poem to music without altering its arrangement.
I was stupid enough to answer them in the
preface to the &lsquo;Damnation of Faust.&rsquo; I have often
wondered why I was never reproached about the book
of &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rsquo; which is not very like the immortal
tragedy. No doubt because Shakspeare was
not a German. Patriotism! Fetichism! Idiotcy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_76">[76]</div>
<p>One night when he had lost his way in Pesth
he wrote the choral refrain of the &ldquo;Ronde des
Paysans&rdquo; by the gaslight in a shop; and at Prague
he arose in the middle of the night to write down
the Angels&rsquo; Chorus in Marguerite&rsquo;s apotheosis. At
Breslau he wrote the Students&rsquo; Latin Song, &ldquo;Jam
nox stellata velamina pandit;&rdquo; and on his return to
France he composed the grand trio in the work
while visiting a friend near Rouen. He concludes:</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The rest was written in Paris, but always improvised,
either at my own house, or at the caf&eacute;, or
in the Tuileries gardens, and even on a stone in the
Boulevard du Temple. I did not search for ideas, I
let them come; and they presented themselves in a
most unforeseen manner. When at last the whole
outline was sketched, I set to work to re-do the whole,
touch up the different parts, unite and blend them
together with all the patience and determination of
which I am capable, and to finish off the instrumentation,
which had only been indicated here and there.
I look upon this as one of my best works, and hitherto
the public seems to be of the same opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This opinion, however, was of slow growth, for of
the first performance of the work he says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;It was the end of November, 1846; snow was
falling; the weather was dreadful. I had no fashionable
cantatrice to sing the part of Marguerite. As for
Roger, who did Faust, and Herman L&eacute;on, who took
the part of Mephistopheles, they might be heard any
day in this same theatre; moreover, they were no
longer the fashion. The result was that Faust was
twice performed to a half-empty room. The concert-going
<span class="pb" id="pg_77">[77]</span>
Parisian public, supposed to be fond of music,
stayed quietly at home, caring as little about my new
work as if I had been an obscure student at the Conservatoire;
and these two performances at the Op&eacute;ra
Comique were no better attended than if they had
been the most wretched operas on the list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The opening scene introduces Faust alone in the
fields at sunrise on the Hungarian plains. He gives
expression to his delight in a tender, placid strain
(&ldquo;The Winter has departed, Spring is here&rdquo;). It is
followed by an instrumental prelude of a pastoral
character, in which are heard fragments of the
roundelay of the peasants and of the fanfare in the
Hungarian march, leading up to the &ldquo;Dance of
Peasants,&rdquo; a brisk, vivacious chorus (&ldquo;The Shepherd
donned his best Array&rdquo;), beginning with the
altos, who are finally joined by the sopranos, tenors,
and basses in constantly accelerating time. The
scene then changes to another part of the plain and
discloses the advance of an army to the brilliant and
stirring music of the R&aacute;k&oacute;czy march.<sup><a id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></sup></p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_78">[78]</div>
<p>The second part (Scene IV.) opens in north Germany
and discloses Faust alone in his chamber, as
in Gounod&rsquo;s opera; he sings a soliloquy, setting
forth his discontent with worldly happiness, and is
about to drown his sorrow with poison, when he is
interrupted by the Easter Hymn (&ldquo;Christ is risen
from the Dead&rdquo;), a stately and jubilant six-part
chorus, in the close of which he joins. As it comes
to an end he continues his song (&ldquo;Heavenly Tones,
why seek me in the Dust?&rdquo;), but is again interrupted
by the sudden apparition of Mephistopheles,
who mockingly sings, &ldquo;Oh, pious Frame of Mind,&rdquo;
and entraps him in the compact. They disappear,
and we next find them in Auerbach&rsquo;s cellar in Leipsic,
where the carousing students are singing a rollicking
drinking-song (&ldquo;O what Delight when Storm
is crashing&rdquo;). The drunken Brander is called
upon for a song, and responds with a characteristic
one (&ldquo;There was a Rat in the Cellar Nest&rdquo;), to
which the irreverent students improvise a fugue on
the word &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; using a motive of the song.
Mephistopheles compliments them on the fugue,
and being challenged to give them an air trolls out
the lusty <i>lied</i>, &ldquo;There was a King once reigning,
who had a big black Flea,&rdquo; in the accompaniment
of which Berlioz makes some very realistic effects.
Amid the bravas of the drunken students they disappear
again, and are next found in the flowery
meadows of the Elbe, where Mephistopheles sings a
most enchanting melody (&ldquo;In this fair Bower&rdquo;).
Faust is lulled to slumber, and in his vision hears
<span class="pb" id="pg_79">[79]</span>
the chorus of the gnomes and sylphs (&ldquo;Sleep,
happy Faust&rdquo;), a number of extraordinary beauty
and fascinating charm. Its effect is still further
heightened by the sylphs&rsquo; ballet in waltz time. As
they gradually disappear, Faust wakes and relates to
Mephistopheles his vision of the &ldquo;angel in human
form.&rdquo; The latter promises to conduct him to her
chamber, and they join a party of soldiers and
students who will pass &ldquo;before thy beauty&rsquo;s dwelling.&rdquo;
The finale of the scene is composed of a
stirring soldiers&rsquo; chorus (&ldquo;Stoutly-walled Cities we
fain would win&rdquo;) and a characteristic students&rsquo;
song in Latin (&ldquo;Jam nox stellata&rdquo;), at first sung
separately and then combined with great skill.</p>
<p>The third part begins with a brief instrumental
prelude, in which the drums and trumpets sound the
tattoo, introducing a scene in Marguerite&rsquo;s chamber,
where Faust sings a passionate love-song
(&ldquo;Thou sweet Twilight, be welcome&rdquo;), corresponding
with the well-known &ldquo;Salve dimora&rdquo; in Gounod&rsquo;s
garden scene. At its close Mephistopheles
warns him of the approach of Marguerite and conceals
him behind a curtain. She enters, and in brief
recitative tells her dream, in which she has seen
the image of Faust, and discloses her love for him.
Then while disrobing she sings the ballad &ldquo;There
was a King in Thule.&rdquo; As its pathetic strains come
to a close, the music suddenly changes and Mephistopheles
in a characteristic strain summons the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps
to bewilder the maiden. It is followed
by their lovely and graceful minuet, in which Berlioz
<span class="pb" id="pg_80">[80]</span>
again displays his wonderful command of orchestral
realism. It is followed by Mephistopheles&rsquo;
serenade (&ldquo;Why dost thou wait at the Door of thy
Lover?&rdquo;), with a choral accompaniment by the will-o&rsquo;-the-wisps,
interspersed with demoniac laughter.
The last number is a trio (&ldquo;Angel adored&rdquo;) for
Marguerite, Faust, and Mephistopheles, wonderfully
expressive in its utterances of passion, and closing
with a chorus of mockery which indicates the
coming tragedy.</p>
<p>The fourth part opens with a very touching romance
(&ldquo;My Heart with Grief is heavy&rdquo;), the familiar
&ldquo;Meine Ruh&rsquo; ist hin&rdquo; of Goethe, sung by
Marguerite, and the scene closes with the songs of
the soldiers and students heard in the distance. In
the next scene Faust sings a sombre and powerful
invocation to Nature (&ldquo;O boundless Nature, Spirit
sublime&rdquo;). Mephistopheles is seen scaling the rocks
and in agitated recitative tells his companion the
story of Marguerite&rsquo;s crime and imprisonment. He
bids him sign a scroll which will save him from the
consequences of the deed, and Faust thus delivers
himself over to the Evil One. Then begins the
wild &ldquo;Ride to Hell,&rdquo; past the peasants praying at
the cross, who flee in terror as they behold the
riders, followed by horrible beasts, monstrous birds,
and grinning, dancing skeletons, until at last they
disappear in an abyss and are greeted by the chorus
of the spirits of hell in a tempest of sound, which
is literally a musical pandemonium (&ldquo;Has! Irimiru
Karabras,&rdquo; etc.) in its discordant vocal strains and in
<span class="pb" id="pg_81">[81]</span>
the mighty dissonances and supernatural effects in
the accompaniment. A brief epilogue, &ldquo;On Earth,&rdquo;
follows, in which Faust&rsquo;s doom is told, succeeded
by a correspondingly brief one, &ldquo;In Heaven,&rdquo; in
which the seraphim plead for Marguerite. The
legend closes with &ldquo;Marguerite&rsquo;s Glorification,&rdquo; a
jubilant double chorus announcing her pardon and
acceptance among the blest.</p>
<div class="fnblock">
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_16" href="#fr_16">[16]</a></sup> This march, though the best known of all Hungarian airs, is
liable to be confounded with others bearing the same name. It
forms one of the group of national patriotic melodies called into
existence by the heroism of the Transylvanian prince Franz R&aacute;k&oacute;tzy,
who at the beginning of the last century fought with rare
valor, though little success, against the dominating power of Austria.
Who composed it remains as unknown as the authorship
of its less familiar companions; but though the origin of the tune,
like that of so many others which nations cherish, is veiled in
mystery, the march has enjoyed an enviable prominence. It was
proscribed by the Austrian Government in the bad days when Hungary
was treated as a conquered appanage of the Hapsburgs; its
performance was a criminal act, and the possession of printed or
written copies, if suspected, brought down domiciliary visits from
the police.&mdash;<i>Albert Hall Programmes</i>, 1874.

<h3>BRAHMS.</h3>
<p>Johannes Brahms, one of the most
eminent of living German composers,
was born at Hamburg, May 7, 1833.
His father was a double-bass player in
the orchestra in that city, and devoted his son at
a very early age to his own profession. His first
piano teacher was Cossell; but to Edward Marxsen,
the royal music director, he owes his real success
as a composer. Brahms remained in Hamburg
until 1853, when he went upon a concert-tour with
Rem&eacute;ny&iacute;, the eccentric and somewhat sensational
Hungarian, who has been a familiar figure upon the
American concert-stage. He remained with him
however but a very short time, for in October of
that year they parted company. Brahms had attracted
the notice of Liszt and Joachim, and it may
have been through their advice that the musical
partnership was dissolved. In any event, soon
after leaving Rem&eacute;ny&iacute; he went to D&uuml;sseldorf and
visited Schumann, who announced him to the musical
world in a very enthusiastic manner. The next
year (1854) appeared his first works,&mdash;three sonatas,
a trio and scherzo for piano, and three books
<span class="pb" id="pg_83">[83]</span>
of songs. After a visit to Liszt at Weimar he
settled down as chorus-conductor and music-teacher
at the court of Lippe-Detmold, where he remained
a few years. After leaving Detmold he successively
resided in Hamburg, Z&uuml;rich, and Baden-Baden,
though most of his time has been spent in Vienna,
where he has directed the Singakademie and the
concerts of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde.
Among his most famous compositions are a funeral
hymn for chorus and wind-band; the &ldquo;German
Requiem;&rdquo; &ldquo;Triumphlied,&rdquo; for double chorus and
orchestra; &ldquo;Schicksalslied,&rdquo; for chorus and orchestra;
six symphonies; variations on a theme of
Haydn, for orchestra; the &ldquo;Tragic&rdquo; and &ldquo;Academic&rdquo;
overtures; besides several trios, quartets,
quintets, sextets, concertos, and sonatas.</p>
</div>
<div id="c022" title="Triumphlied">
<h4>Triumphlied.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Triumphlied&rdquo; (&ldquo;Song of Triumph&rdquo;) was written
by Brahms in commemoration of the victories
of German arms and the re-establishment of the
Empire, and is dedicated to &ldquo;the German Emperor
Wilhelm I.&rdquo; It was first performed at the fifty-first
festival of the Lower Rhine at Cologne in 1873.
The text is a paraphrase of certain verses in the
nineteenth chapter of Revelation, and reads as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Hallelujah, praise the Lord! Honor and power
and glory to God!</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;For in righteousness and truth the Lord giveth
judgment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_84">[84]</div>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Glory be to God, all ye His servants, and ye that
fear Him, all both humble and mighty.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Hallelujah, for the omnipotent God hath exalted
His kingdom.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;O, be joyful, let all be glad, to Him alone give
honor.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Behold, the heavens opened wide, and yonder a
snow-white horse, and on him sat one called Steadfast
and Faithful, who warreth and judgeth all with righteousness.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;And he treads the wine-press of wrath of the Lord
God Almighty.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Lo! a great name hath he written upon his vesture
and upon his girdle.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;A King of kings and Lord of lords! Hallelujah!
Amen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scriptural selections are divided into three
movements, written for double chorus (with the
exception of two short barytone solos), orchestra,
and organ, and are introduced by a brief instrumental
prelude of a solemn but animated and exultant
character, in the closing measures of which
both choirs break in with jubilant shouts of &ldquo;Hallelujah!
praise the Lord!&rdquo; The theme of the movement
is the stirring old German song &ldquo;Heil dir im
Siegerkranz,&rdquo;<sup><a id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a></sup>
which is worked up with consummate
skill. The first part closes with a climax of
<span class="pb" id="pg_85">[85]</span>
power and contrapuntal effect hardly to be found
elsewhere outside the choruses of Handel.</p>
<p>The second movement (&ldquo;Glory be to God!&rdquo;) is
of the same general character as the first. After
the opening ascription, a short fugue intervenes,
leading to a fresh melody alternately sung by both
choruses.</p>
<p>The third movement, after a very brief but spirited
orchestral flourish, opens with an exultant barytone
solo (&ldquo;And behold then the Heavens opened
wide&rdquo;). The choruses respond with animation
(&ldquo;And yonder a snow-white Horse&rdquo;). Again the
barytone intervenes (&ldquo;And lo! a great Name hath
He written&rdquo;), and then the choruses take up the
majestic theme, &ldquo;King of Kings and Lord of Lords,&rdquo;
each answering the other with triumphant shouts
that gather force and fire as they proceed, and closing
with a mighty hallelujah in which voices, orchestra,
and organ join with fullest power to produce
one of the grandest harmonies ever written. The
work is one of extreme difficulty, as the two choirs
are treated independently and their harmonies are
complicated, though blended in general effect.
Neither choir receives assistance from the other.
In fact, each rank of voices is required to perform
music of the most exacting kind, so that a perfect
performance of this great jubilee hymn requires
singers of trained skill and more than ordinary intelligence.
When thus given, few choruses of
modern times reveal such artistic richness and
symmetrical proportions.</p>

<h3>BRUCH.</h3>
<p>Max Bruch, one of the most successful
choral composers of the present time, was
born at Cologne, Jan. 6, 1838. His father
was a government official, and his mother
a singer of more than ordinary ability. He received
his early instructions, under her watchful supervision,
from Professor Breidenstein, at Bonn. In 1852
he continued his studies with Hiller, Reinecke, and
Breuning, at Cologne; and at this time began to
produce compositions which gave unusual promise.
In 1865 he was musical director at Coblenz, and
subsequently at Berlin, where he conducted the
Singakademie. In 1867 he was appointed chapel-master
to the Prince of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen,&mdash;a
post which he held until 1870. Since that time
he has also been honored with a call to the directorship
of the Liverpool Philharmonic Society. For
some years past he has lived at Bonn and Berlin,
and devoted himself exclusively to composition.
His first public appearance as a composer was in
connection with the performance of his operetta,
&ldquo;Scherz, List und Rache,&rdquo; set to Goethe&rsquo;s words;
<span class="pb" id="pg_87">[87]</span>
following which he produced several chamber compositions,
among them a trio (op. 5), two string
quartets (op. 9, 10), Capriccio (op. 2) for four
hands, Fantasie (op. 11) for two pianos, the G minor
and D minor violin concertos, besides two symphonies.
He has also written an oratorio, &ldquo;Arminius,&rdquo;
and two operas, &ldquo;Loreley,&rdquo; to the text which the
poet Geibel wrote for Mendelssohn, and &ldquo;Hermione,&rdquo;
an adaptation of Shakspeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Winter&rsquo;s
Tale.&rdquo; His greatest successes, however, have been
made with his works in the cantata form, as he is
a recognized master in writing for large masses of
voices and instruments, though many of his solo
melodies possess great beauty. In this class of his
compositions the most conspicuous are &ldquo;Scenes
from the Frithjof-Saga,&rdquo; familiarly known as &ldquo;Frithjof,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Flight of the Holy Family,&rdquo; &ldquo;Roman Triumph
Song,&rdquo; &ldquo;Roman Obsequies,&rdquo; &ldquo;Salamis,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Fair Ellen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Odysseus,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Rorate Coeli.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div id="c024" title="Frithjof">
<h4>Frithjof.</h4>
<p>The story of the old Norse hero Frithjof is told
with exceeding spirit and beauty in the &ldquo;Frithjof&rsquo;s
Saga&rdquo; of Esaias Tegn&eacute;r, Bishop of Wexi&ouml;, Sweden,
which has been translated into almost every European
language, and to which music has been
adapted by Crusell, Hedda Wrangel, Boman, Sandberg,
Zanders, Caroline Ridderstolpe, Panny, Silcher,
and other Scandinavian and German composers. It
was Bishop Tegn&eacute;r&rsquo;s Saga from which Bruch derived
<span class="pb" id="pg_88">[88]</span>
the incidents of his musical setting of this
stirring Norse theme.<sup><a id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></sup></p>
<p>To make the text of the libretto intelligible, the
incidents leading up to it must be briefly told.
Frithjof was the son of Thorstein, a friend of King
Bele of Baldershage, and was in love with Ingeborg,
the king&rsquo;s daughter and his foster sister. Bele died,
and left his kingdom to his two sons. When Thorstein
passed away, he bequeathed to his son his
ship &ldquo;Ellida&rdquo; and his gold ring. Soon thereafter
Frithjof sailed across the fiord to demand the hand
of Ingeborg. Her brothers Helge and Halfdan
scorned his suit, whereupon Frithjof swore they
should never have help from him. King Ring, a
neighboring monarch, hearing of the trouble between
them, improved the opportunity to menace
their kingdom. The brothers appealed to Frithjof
for aid, but he turned a deaf ear; and when they
took the field against Bele, he returned to Baldershage
and made love to Ingeborg, with whom he
exchanged rings. Helge and Halfdan were defeated
by Ring, and as part of the indemnity he
demanded Ingeborg&rsquo;s hand. Finding upon their
return that Frithjof had been there without their
permission, they required him as a penalty to go
to the Orkneys and collect the tribute which the
<span class="pb" id="pg_89">[89]</span>
islanders had neglected to pay since the death of
Bele. Frithjof sailed away in &ldquo;Ellida.&rdquo; Meanwhile
the brothers resorted to witchcraft to raise a
storm that should destroy his vessel, burned his barrow,
and married the lamenting Ingeborg to Ring.</p>
<p>It is at this point that the text of the cantata begins.
The first scene pictures the return of Frithjof
and his joy at the prospect of seeing Ingeborg,
whose hand the false brothers had promised him if
he were successful. Learning what had occurred
in his absence, Frithjof goes to the temple where
the kings are sacrificing, hurls the tribute in Helge&rsquo;s
face, fires the edifice, and hurries to the sea, pursued
by his enemies. The hero sails away again
in &ldquo;Ellida,&rdquo; and becomes a sea-rover. The text
closes with this incident. In the Saga, after gaining
great fame, Frithjof returns and goes disguised as a
salt-burner to Ring&rsquo;s palace. The king recognized
him, and moved by his sad story became his friend
and appointed him guardian of his heir. Ring died
soon after, and Frithjof married Ingeborg. Helge
and Halfdan made war against him, Helge was
killed, and Halfdan became his vassal.</p>
<p>The cantata opens with an animated instrumental
introduction, &ldquo;Frithjof&rsquo;s Return,&rdquo; leading to the
barytone recitative and aria (&ldquo;How bravely o&rsquo;er
the Flood so bright&rdquo;),&mdash;a very expressive song,
interspersed with the tender, graceful chorus of his
companions (&ldquo;O, &rsquo;tis Delight when the Land far
appeareth&rdquo;). The second scene is preluded with
a wedding march, whose blithe measures are in
<span class="pb" id="pg_90">[90]</span>
marked contrast with the bridal chorus (&ldquo;Sadly the
Skald walks before the Train&rdquo;), and Ingeborg&rsquo;s song
(&ldquo;My Heart with Sorrow overflowing&rdquo;), which describes
her grief over her unhappy destiny. The
third scene (&ldquo;Frithjof&rsquo;s Revenge&rdquo;), for barytone,
chorus, and orchestra, is one of great power in its
dramatic and descriptive character, as well as in its
masterly instrumentation. It begins with a chorus of
priests (&ldquo;Midnight Sun on the Mountain burns&rdquo;),
gradually accelerating until it is interrupted by
Frithjof&rsquo;s cry (&ldquo;Go to Helas&rsquo; dark Abode&rdquo;).
Three bars of chorus intervene (&ldquo;Woe! O wicked
Deed&rdquo;), when Frithjof, after a short recitative, sings
a spirited aria (&ldquo;Where my Father rests&rdquo;). At its
close, as he rescues Ingeborg&rsquo;s ring and fires the
temple, the chorus resumes (&ldquo;Woe! he tugs with
all his Might at the Ring&rdquo;). The choral finale of
this scene, with its effective instrumentation, is a
masterpiece of dramatic music, worthy to rank with
the highest work of its kind in opera. After the
storm, the calm. In that calm occurs a melodical
episode of an extraordinary character. The melody
itself is so unlike anything which precedes or follows
it that it must have been interpolated. In
grateful contrast with the revenge of Frithjof, the
burning of the temple, and the curses of the infuriated
priests, comes the fourth scene, &ldquo;Frithjof&rsquo;s
Departure from the Northland,&rdquo;&mdash;a solo quartet
for male voices (&ldquo;Sun in the Sky now mounteth
high&rdquo;), of exquisite harmony, leading up to and accompanying
a barytone solo which has rarely been
<span class="pb" id="pg_91">[91]</span>
surpassed in the tender beauty of its melody or the majestic
sonority of its style:<sup><a id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></sup>&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;World&rsquo;s grandest region, thou mighty North!</p>
<p class="t0">From thy dominions I am driven forth;</p>
<p class="t0">Within thy border I lov&rsquo;d to dwell;</p>
<p class="t0">Midsummer sun, farewell, farewell.</p>

<p class="t0">Hopeless I must bear my lot.</p>

<p class="t0">And Thor commandeth clouds and winds;</p>
<p class="t0">Ye azure lakes, that I love so well,</p>
<p class="t0">Ye woods and brakes, farewell.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_92">[92]</div>
<p>The fifth scene is Ingeborg&rsquo;s lament for her lost
lover (&ldquo;Storms wildly roar&rdquo;),&mdash;a soprano solo,
which, if not as dramatic as the music assigned to
Frithjof, is nevertheless full of beautiful sentiment.
The work closes with a delightful chorus, with short
phrases for Frithjof (&ldquo;Now he crosseth the Floods
of the salt desert Waste&rdquo;), supposed to be sung on
board the hero&rsquo;s good ship &ldquo;Ellida&rdquo; as they sail off
for conquest and the enjoyment of the booty he has
promised his companions.</p>

<h4>Salamis.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Salamis, Triumphal Hymn of the Greeks&rdquo; was
written in 1862. It is a composition mostly for
male chorus, and is admirably adapted for festival
purposes. The poem, which celebrates the defeat
of Xerxes, is by H. Lingg, and runs as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Adorn the ships with Persian trophies!</p>
<p class="t0">Let the purple sails be swelled!</p>
<p class="t0">Joy floats about the masts!</p>
<p class="t0">Evoe, the mighty foe, is vanquished!</p>
<p class="t0">We broke, O sea, we broke the bond,</p>
<p class="t0">Which the Persian Prince threw around thy neck.</p>
<p class="t0">Thou rollest now unfettered, no longer embittered</p>
<p class="t0">By the hateful trampling of the horses,</p>
<p class="t0">Which thy waving surface,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy bridge-fettered wrath, bore reluctantly.</p>
<p class="t0">Fate overtook Xerxes</p>
<p class="t0">And achieved a Hellenic victory on the waves.</p>
<p class="t0">To the tyrant, to the arbitrary master,</p>
<p class="t0">Did not succumb the people that dwell by the sea,</p>
<p class="t0">For the old ruler of the sea filled his beloved race</p>
<p class="t0">With boundless courage for the sea-fight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_93">[93]</div>
<p class="t0">All around, the waves with delight</p>
<p class="t0">Hear many an Ionic song;</p>
<p class="t0">They roar and join the p&aelig;an</p>
<p class="t0">After the splendid struggle</p>
<p class="t0">There arise dithyrambic days of liberty!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The instrumental introduction to the work is
written in massive style, its grand chorus being
elegantly interwoven with runs by the wood instruments,
preparing the way for the festive adorning of
the ships,&mdash;a very beautiful allegro movement. This
is followed by a slower movement which pictures
the breaking of the bond, the rolling of the sea, and
the trampling of the horses with all that vividness
for which the composer is famous. It is succeeded
by a passage which is very stately, particularly in
the basses (&ldquo;Fate overtook Xerxes&rdquo;), leading up to
the grand climax (&ldquo;All around, the Waves with
Delight&rdquo;), when the orchestra and voices are in
splendid accord. After a short repetition of the
opening allegro the hymn closes. It would be hard
to find a more admirable musical setting of a poem
than this, whether in the strength and beauty of its
vocal parts, or in the color, vigor, and general effectiveness
of the instrumentation.</p>
</div>
<div id="c026" title="Fair Ellen">
<h4>Fair Ellen.</h4>
<p>The heroic defence of Lucknow by its British
garrison in 1857, during the Sepoy rebellion, is one
of the most memorable events in the English administration
of India. The world is familiar with
the story of the disaffection of the native troops,
<span class="pb" id="pg_94">[94]</span>
the failure of Sir Henry Lawrence, who was in
command, to overcome the mutiny, the stubborn
defence which the brave little garrison made against
the repeated assaults of the native troops, their
temporary assistance from Outram and Havelock,
who cut their way into the city, and the final
relief which was brought to them by Sir Colin
Campbell. Of all the stirring incidents of the
siege, however, not one has made such a strong
impression as the fanciful story of the Scotch girl
who heard the slogan of the MacGregors far
away and knew the Highlanders were coming to
their rescue.</p>
<p>It is this incident which Bruch has used as the
theme of his cantata &ldquo;Sch&ouml;n Ellen&rdquo; (&ldquo;Fair
Ellen&rdquo;). The story is identical with the one so
often told in prose and poetry, but the <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> differ. Instead of General Lawrence
we have Lord Edward, and instead of familiar
Jessie Brown we have &ldquo;Fair Ellen.&rdquo; The text
of the libretto is weak and spiritless as compared
with that of the poetical versions. The
salient point of the story is thus versified in the
former:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Campbells are coming, I told you true;</p>
<p class="t">I hear the bugle blowing:</p>
<p class="t0">The pibroch is borne adown the wind,</p>
<p class="t">The tones on the breezes quiver;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Neath the tread of battalions that hurry along</p>
<p class="t">Afar the plains do shiver.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Compare the above with the corresponding verses
from Robert Lowell&rsquo;s fine poem:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_95">[95]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Highlanders! O dinna ye hear</p>
<p class="t">The slogan far awa?</p>
<p class="t0">The MacGregors? Ah! I ken it weel;</p>
<p class="t">It&rsquo;s the grandest of them a&rsquo;.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="gs3">*       *       *       *       *</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Then Jessie said, &lsquo;The slogan&rsquo;s dune,</p>
<p class="t">But can ye no hear them noo?</p>
<p class="t0">The Campbells are comin&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s nae a dream;</p>
<p class="t">Our succors hae broken through.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Weak as the text may be, the strong healthy
music of the cantata makes ample compensation.
It is quite brief, there being but two solo parts,
&ldquo;Fair Ellen&rdquo; (soprano) and Lord Edward (barytone),
and five short chorus numbers. The former
are vigorous and somewhat declamatory in style,
but the choruses are very melodious and stirring.
The instrumentation is unusually effective, and a fine
point is made in the climax by the interweaving of
the familiar air, &ldquo;The Campbells are Coming,&rdquo; with
the orchestral score. It lends spirit and color to
the finale, and closes up the work with a fine burst
of powerful effect. Short as it is, &ldquo;Fair Ellen&rdquo;
will always be a favorite with popular audiences.</p>
</div>
<div id="c027" title="Odysseus">
<h4>Odysseus.</h4>
<p>The cantata of &ldquo;Odysseus,&rdquo; like that of &ldquo;Frithjof,&rdquo;
is made up of detached scenes, in this case
selected from the Odyssey and arranged by William
Paul Graff. The work was first produced in
1872, and has met with great success in Germany,
England, and the United States. It is divided into
<span class="pb" id="pg_96">[96]</span>
two parts, the first containing four, and the second,
six scenes. The characters are as numerous as
those of a grand opera, and include Odysseus,
barytone; Penelope, alto; Alcinoos, King of the
Pheaces, bass; Arete, his consort, alto; Nausicaa,
their daughter, soprano; the Helmsman, bass; Pallas
Athene, soprano; Leucothea, soprano; Spirit of
Tiresias, bass; Spirit of Anticlia, Odysseus&rsquo; mother,
alto; and Hermes, tenor. In performance, however,
the parts of Arete and the Spirit of Anticlia,
as well as of Nausicaa and Pallas Athene, are usually
doubled. The choruses, which are a very important
feature of the work, are assigned to Odysseus&rsquo;
companions, Spirits of the Departed, Sirens, Tritons,
Nymphs of the sea, Pheaces, Rhapsodes, boatmen
and people of Ithaca.</p>
<p>In the first scene Odysseus is discovered on
Calypso&rsquo;s enchanted island longing for home.
Hermes, the messenger of the gods, appears to
him and announces that the Immortals, touched
by his sorrow, will rescue him and restore him to
Penelope. In the next scene the wanderer has
reached the abysses of Erebus, &ldquo;where, loud
thundering, the flood of Cocytus pours its black
wave into Acheron&rsquo;s tide.&rdquo; Here he invokes the
world of shades. The spirits of children, brides,
youths, and old men successively appear to him and
narrate their mournful stories. Then Tiresias the
bard warns him of the Sirens, and Anticlia his
mother bids him hasten to Penelope. In the third
scene he passes the isles of the Sirens, and escapes
<span class="pb" id="pg_97">[97]</span>
their wiles through the firmness of his companions.
The fourth scene describes the storm at sea, the
wreck of the vessel, and Odysseus&rsquo; rescue by
Leucothea, who gives him the veil the Immortals
have woven, and bids the Oceanides and Tritons
guide him safely to land; and the first part closes
with our hero peacefully sleeping on the flowery
shore of the island of Pheacia.</p>
<p>The second part opens with the lament of Penelope
and her prayer to the gods to restore her
husband to her. The sixth scene changes to the
island again, and discloses Odysseus awakened from
his slumbers by the sports and dances of Nausicaa
and her joyful maidens. He appeals to her for
help and refreshment, and is bidden to partake of
their hospitality. In the next scene a sumptuous
banquet is spread for him, at which he reveals his
identity and asks that he be allowed to return to
his home. The fair Nausicaa, though suddenly
enamoured of the handsome stranger, conceals her
passion and expedites his departure. The eighth
scene gives us a sketch of Penelope weaving the
garment, the <i>ruse</i> by which she kept her suitors
aloof.</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;This garment by day I weave in my sorrow,</p>
<p class="t0">And ravel the web in the still hour of night;</p>
<p class="t0">Thus wearying long, yet my tears greet the morrow,</p>
<p class="t0">Hope vanishes as the long years take flight.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The ninth scene opens with the arrival of
Odysseus at Ithaca. The sleeping wanderer is
borne ashore by his comrades, and upon awaking
<span class="pb" id="pg_98">[98]</span>
from his slumbers fails to recognize his own country
until Pallas Athene appears to him. The goddess
convinces him that he is at home once more, and
then discloses the plot of the suitors, who are revelling
in his palace, to compel Penelope to select one
of them that day in order that they may gain
possession of his property, as well as their conspiracy
for his destruction, from which she promises
to protect him. The final scene describes the
glad acclamations of the people as they recognize
Odysseus, and the joy of Penelope as she welcomes
him home once more.</p>
<p>The orchestral introduction is very free and flowing
in character, and its themes are taken from the
duet of Odysseus and Penelope, which occurs later
on. The opening chorus of Calypso&rsquo;s nymphs
(&ldquo;Here, O Hermes, in midst of the Island&rdquo;) is very
graceful in its movement and is set to a most delightful
accompaniment. It is followed by Odysseus&rsquo;
lament (&ldquo;Flow, ye Tears, since Days are hateful&rdquo;),
at first tender in its character, then changing to passionate
utterances as the remembrance of Penelope
comes to him, and closing with a hopeful strain after
the promise of help from Zeus. In the second or
Hades scene the music changes from its bright color
to a gloomier minor tone. It opens with a male
chorus (&ldquo;The Bounds we have reached of the deep
flowing Ocean&rdquo;), pianissimo, gradually increasing in
intensity and accompanied by remarkable effects in
tone-color as the orchestra describes &ldquo;the thundering
of the flood Cocytus&rdquo; and &ldquo;the surging aloft of
<span class="pb" id="pg_99">[99]</span>
the shadows of the departed.&rdquo; It is followed by
semi-choruses of the shades, and closes with a very
spirited and dramatic male chorus (&ldquo;Dread on
Dread! Lo, surging aloft, the numberless Hosts of
Departed&rdquo;). The third scene opens with a fresh
and characteristic male chorus (&ldquo;Our Sails to the
Breezes&rdquo;), followed by the graceful and alluring
chorus of the sirens (&ldquo;Come, great Odysseus, Hero
of Might&rdquo;). The last scene is almost entirely choral
and very dramatic in its effect, especially the opening
number for the Oceanides and Tritons (&ldquo;Hark!
the Storm gathers from afar&rdquo;), with its vigorous instrumental
description of the tempest, and the closing
number for full chorus (&ldquo;Yonder beckons the
wood-crested Harbor&rdquo;), which in its tenderness and
joyousness forms a striking contrast to the earlier
part of the scene.</p>
<p>The second part is introduced with a dignified and
sombre recitative (&ldquo;Thou far-darting Sun&rdquo;), followed
by an aria of the same character (&ldquo;Oh! Atritone&rdquo;)
in which Penelope bewails the absence of Odysseus.
In the next scene the music changes to a bright and
tripping strain, the chorus of Nausicaa&rsquo;s maidens
(&ldquo;On the flowery Mead, girt by the dimpling Tide&rdquo;),
which closely resembles that of Calypso&rsquo;s nymphs
in the first scene. After Odysseus&rsquo; fervent appeal
(&ldquo;Hark to me! Queen, or heaven-dwelling Goddess&rdquo;)
the banquet scene occurs. It begins with
an animated chorus of the Pheacians (&ldquo;Be welcome,
Stranger, to Pheacia&rsquo;s Land&rdquo;), followed by an exquisite
unison chorus of the Rhapsodes (&ldquo;Ten Years
<span class="pb" id="pg_100">[100]</span>
now are past since Troy in the Dust was laid&rdquo;), set
to an accompaniment of harps. A simple and tender
melody (&ldquo;Let me then depart in Peace&rdquo;), sung
by Odysseus, in which the chorus singers gradually
join, closes the scene. The eighth scene contains
the most expressive solo number of the work, Penelope&rsquo;s
aria (&ldquo;This Garment by Day I weave in my
Sorrow&rdquo;), with a characteristic descriptive accompaniment.
The gems of the ninth scene are Odysseus&rsquo;
passionate aria (&ldquo;O my Fatherland! blest
Remembrance!&rdquo;) and his furious revenge song
(&ldquo;Miscreant! woe to Thee&rdquo;). The last scene opens
with a joyous chorus of the people (&ldquo;Say, have ye
heard the Tidings of Joy?&rdquo;), followed by a fervent
duet between Odysseus and Penelope (&ldquo;Omnipotent
Zeus! we call on thy Name&rdquo;). The final chorus
begins in chorale style (&ldquo;In Flames ascending&rdquo;),
and after repeating the melody of Odysseus&rsquo; song
in the seventh scene (&ldquo;Nowhere abides such Delight&rdquo;),
closes with a fine fugued passage (&ldquo;Slayer
of Darkness&rdquo;).</p>

<h3>BUCK.</h3>
<p>Dudley Buck, one of the most eminent
of American organists and composers, was
born March 10, 1839, at Hartford, Conn.,
where his father was engaged in the mercantile
business. He studied both the piano and
organ, the latter with such success that at the age
of sixteen he was appointed organist at St. John&rsquo;s
Church in his native city. In 1858 he went to Europe
and entered the Leipsic Conservatory, where
he studied the piano with Plaidy and Moscheles, and
composition with Hauptmann and Richter. After
remaining there a year and a half he went to Dresden
and began the study of Bach&rsquo;s music with Johann
Schneider. A year and a half later he went to Paris,
and there acquainted himself with French music and
musicians. He returned to this country in 1862,
and accepted the position of organist at the Park
Church, Hartford, but after the death of his parents
removed to Chicago, where he obtained the position
of organist at St. James&rsquo;s Episcopal Church, and also
devoted much of his time to teaching and composition.
In that city his home became a musical centre.
<span class="pb" id="pg_102">[102]</span>
His library, fine organ, and music-room were
great attractions, and he had laid the foundation of
a brilliant musical career, when the great fire of 1871
swept away his entire property, including many manuscript
compositions. Like many other musicians at
that time he left the city, seeing no prospect of advantage
to him where it would require a long time
to recover purely material losses. He went with his
family to Boston, where his fame was already established,
and obtained the position of organist at St.
Paul&rsquo;s Church, as well as the charge of the large
organ in the Music Hall. After remaining a short
time in that city he removed to New York, where
he has since resided. His life has been a very busy
one, and he has had an important influence, both
personally and in connection with Theodore Thomas,
upon the progress of music in this country. It is
not extravagant to say that there are few Protestant
churches whose music has not been dignified and
improved by his contributions, particularly of anthems
and Te Deums, as well as of compositions for
the organ, of which he is a consummate master.
Singing societies are also indebted to him for many
elegant four-part songs. Among his larger works
are the cantata &ldquo;Don Munio&rdquo; (1874); the &ldquo;Centennial,&rdquo;
written for the Centennial at Philadelphia;
&ldquo;The Nun of Nidaros&rdquo; (1878); &ldquo;The Golden Legend,&rdquo;
which was the prize cantata at the Cincinnati
Festival of 1880; an Easter cantata; the Forty-sixth
Psalm, written for the Boston Handel and Haydn
Society; two volumes of sacred songs and motets;
<span class="pb" id="pg_103">[103]</span>
&ldquo;Marmion,&rdquo; a symphonic overture, and other works
for orchestra; the cantatas &ldquo;Voyage of Columbus&rdquo;
(1885) and the &ldquo;Light of Asia&rdquo; (1886). The last
two cantatas were issued in Europe, the one in Germany
and the other in England, and thus came to
this country bearing a foreign imprint,&mdash;a novelty
for an American composer.</p>
</div>
<div id="c029" title="Don Munio">
<h4>Don Munio</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Don Munio,&rdquo; a dramatic cantata for solos, chorus,
and orchestra, was written in 1874. The
story of it is taken from Washington Irving&rsquo;s Spanish
papers, and the scene is laid in the period of the
wars with the Moors. While hunting one morning,
Don Munio de Hinojosa captures a cavalcade
which is escorting the Moorish Prince, Abadil, and
his betrothed, Constanza, on the way to their
wedding. The Prince, all escape being cut off,
seeks to purchase the good-will of Don Munio with
his gold and jewels, and implores him not to separate
him from his affianced. The Don, touched by
their unfortunate condition, invites them to spend a
fortnight at his castle, promising that the nuptials
shall be celebrated there, and then they shall be
released. The lovers accept, and Don Munio is
faithful to his promise. Shortly after their departure
he is ordered by the king to join in the expedition
to Palestine. In one of the encounters of
this crusade he is killed by Abadil, who does not
<span class="pb" id="pg_104">[104]</span>
recognize his former benefactor with his visor closed.
His death is greatly mourned in Spain, but they are
consoled when Roderigo, a messenger from Palestine,
arrives and tells them that one evening while
strolling near the Holy Sepulchre he saw seventy
Christian knights riding in ghostly procession, with
the late Don Munio at their head. This is regarded
as an assurance that all is well with him. <i>Requiescat
in pace.</i></p>
<p>These are the incidents which Mr. Buck has
chosen for musical treatment, and he has done the
work excellently well. After the orchestral introduction
follows a spirited hunting-song for male
chorus. The next scene opens in the chamber of
Donna Maria, wife of Don Munio, who laments his
absence in a minor strain, to which succeeds a
rondo movement. The third is religious in character,
marked &ldquo;Evening. Close of vesper service in
the chapel of the castle. Escobedo, the chaplain,
with the women, and such retainers as have not
followed Don Munio on his expedition.&rdquo; It begins
with a prelude closing with full orchestra and
organ, and leading to barytone solo and chorus,
and a short exhortation to prayer by Escobedo.
The next number is an Ave Maria for full chorus,
which is very beautifully harmonized. In the next
scene we encounter Don Munio in the forest, and
are treated to the conventional hunting-song. The
next number hints at the approach of the Moors,
which is soon disclosed by a pretty three-part chorus
of &ldquo;the females of the Moorish cavalcade as
<span class="pb" id="pg_105">[105]</span>
they journey.&rdquo; The eighth scene contains some
powerful chorus work, divided between the furious
Spaniards and the frightened women, and set to a
very vigorous accompaniment. After the tumult
ends, Abadil very melodiously appeals to Don Munio,
followed by a brief arioso in which the latter
makes his terms, and a spirited chorus of gratitude
to the Don, which close the first part.</p>
<p>After a short prelude, the second part opens
with a tenor aria for Abadil (&ldquo;O, thou my Star&rdquo;)
which is very refined in sentiment. It is followed
by the chorale &ldquo;Jesu, dulcis Memoria,&rdquo; sung by
the chapel choir. A duet ensues between the two
lovers on the castle terrace, which is very Italian in
its flavor, and one of the most effective numbers
in the cantata. The next two numbers furnish the
wedding music,&mdash;a happy bridal chorus, and a
charming bolero for orchestra. These lead to an
unaccompanied quartet between Don Munio, Donna
Maria, Abadil, and Constanza (&ldquo;It is the Lot of
Friends to part&rdquo;). In the next scene occurs a vigorous
duet between Don Munio and his wife, in
which he informs her of his speedy departure for
Palestine, followed by a stirring battle-hymn for
male chorus. The next scene, &ldquo;The chapel of the
castle, choir chanting the dirge for the dead,&rdquo; is in
strong contrast with the preceding. Mr. Buck has
rarely written anything better in his sacred music
than this beautiful requiem. In the next two numbers
the messenger describes the manner of Don
Munio&rsquo;s death, and the ghostly vision at the sepulchre,
<span class="pb" id="pg_106">[106]</span>
and at the end of his message the requiem
changes to a jubilant chorus of gratitude (&ldquo;In
thankful Hymns ascending&rdquo;). &ldquo;Don Munio&rdquo; is
one of the most powerful and spontaneous of American
compositions, and needs but little more amplification
to deserve the name of opera.</p>
</div>
<div id="c030" title="Centennial Meditation of Columbia">
<h4>The Centennial Meditation of Columbia.</h4>
<p>The National Centennial celebration at Philadelphia
was inaugurated May 10, 1876, with a special
musical programme, in which the cantata with
the above formidable title occupied a prominent
place. The ode was written by Sydney Lanier, of
Georgia, a poet who prior to that time had made
considerable reputation by two poems printed in
&ldquo;Lippincott&rsquo;s Magazine.&rdquo; The national idea was
satisfied by assigning the music to Dudley Buck, at
that time living in Connecticut. It must be acknowledged
that the work did not make a deep impression,
although it contains some excellent musical
writing, and for two sufficient reasons. First, it is
not a work of musical genius or inspiration, as it
was ordered by a commission for a popular show.
It was not singular in this respect. The &ldquo;Centennial
March,&rdquo; written by Richard Wagner, for the
same occasion, is page after page of sound and
fury, executed for a most exorbitant remuneration.
To ascertain its real want of inspiration one has but
<span class="pb" id="pg_107">[107]</span>
to place it by the side of the &ldquo;Kaiser March,&rdquo; with
its massive chords, its grand thematic treatment,
and its stately movement, the outcome of patriotic
fervor and national triumph. Second, the stilted
and unmusical lines furnished by Mr. Lanier must
have hampered the composer in every verse. This
is all the more remarkable because Mr. Lanier himself
was a practical musician. He had been for
some time a violinist in the Peabody orchestra at
Baltimore, under that accomplished leader, Asgar
Hamerik. It is remarkable, therefore, that he
should not have recognized the difficulties he was
placing in the way both of the composer and the
performers.</p>
<p>The ode has sixty-one lines, divided into eight
stanzas of unequal lengths. It sketches the past
and present of the nation, the powers which opposed
its progress and hindered the development
of its freedom, and the elements which at last produced
success, closing with cheering auguries for
the future, and a welcome to the world. All this
might have been set to smooth and fluent verse,
which would readily have adapted itself to music;
but what composer could have treated successfully
such verses as these?&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Mayflower, Mayflower, slowly hither flying,</p>
<p class="t0">Trembling westward o&rsquo;er yon balking sea,</p>
<p class="t0">Hearts within, &lsquo;Farewell, dear England,&rsquo; sighing,</p>
<p class="t0">Winds without, &lsquo;But dear in vain,&rsquo; replying,</p>
<p class="t0">Gray-lipp&rsquo;d waves about thee shouted, crying,</p>
<p class="t4">&lsquo;No! it shall not be!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="t0">Fever cries, &lsquo;Ye burn; away!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Hunger cries, &lsquo;Ye starve; away!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Vengeance cries, &lsquo;Your graves shall stay!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t4">&ldquo;Hark!</p>
<p class="t0">Huguenots whispering &lsquo;Yea&rsquo; in the dark,</p>
<p class="t0">Puritans answering &lsquo;Yea&rsquo; in the dark!</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Yea,&rsquo; like an arrow shot true to his mark,</p>
<p class="t0">Darts through the tyrannous heart of Denial.</p>
<p class="t0">Patience and Labor and solemn-souled Trial,</p>
<p class="t4">Foiled, still beginning,</p>

<p class="t0">Toil, when wild brother-wars new-dark the light,</p>
<p class="t0">Toil, and forgive, and kiss o&rsquo;er, and re-plight.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Even in the last verse, where the composer
must make his climax, and the singers must be
most effective, they are confronted with this
unsingable line:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And wave the world&rsquo;s best lover&rsquo;s welcome to the world.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The only musical verse is the reply of the angel
to Columbia in the midst of her ragged and cacophonous
meditation, which the composer selected as a solo for bass
voice:<sup><a id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></sup>&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Long as thine Art shall love true love,</p>
<p class="t0">Long as thy Science truth shall know,</p>
<p class="t0">Long as thine Eagle harms no Dove,</p>
<p class="t0">Long as thy Law by law shall grow,</p>
<p class="t0">Long as thy God is God above,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy brother every man below,</p>
<p class="t0">So long, dear Land of all my love,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy name shall shine, thy fame shall grow.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_109">[109]</div>
<p>The prelude for orchestra determines the motive
of the whole cantata, and is very spirited; for here,
at least, the composer was not hampered by words.
The opening verse,&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;From this hundred-terraced height,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>is set very effectively in chorale form; but the next
two verses, already quoted, are arranged for semi-chorus
and full chorus, and close in a vocal stretto
quite as hysterical as the words. Then follows the
whispering of the Huguenots and Puritans, commencing
<i>sotto voce</i>, and gradually increasing to a
<i>forte</i> at the close. A few bars for the horn lead
to the bass solo, &ldquo;Long as thine Art,&rdquo; with horn
obligato,&mdash;a very impressive and dignified aria,
and one which would speedily become a favorite
in the concert-room if adapted to the words.
The final number (&ldquo;Music from this Height of
Time&rdquo;) begins in full choral harmony and closes
with a vigorous and well-written fugue.</p>
<div class="fnblock">
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_20" href="#fr_20">[20]</a></sup> Sung upon that occasion by Mr. Myron D. Whitney.

<div id="c031" title="The Golden Legend">
<h4>The Golden Legend.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Golden Legend&rdquo; was written in competition
for the prize of one thousand dollars, which the
Cincinnati May Festival Association offered in 1879
for the best work of a native composer. The judges
were Theodore Thomas, Otto Singer, Asgar Hamerik,
Carl Zerrahn, and the late Dr. Leopold Damrosch.
Their award was made to &ldquo;The Golden Legend,&rdquo;
and it was first performed at the Festival of 1880,
<span class="pb" id="pg_110">[110]</span>
with Miss Annie B. Norton as Elsie, Mr. Frederick
Harvey as Prince Henry, Mr. J. F. Rudolphsen as
Lucifer, and Mr. M. D. Whitney as Friar Paul.</p>
<p>The text of the cantata is composed of a prologue,
epilogue, and twelve scenes taken from Longfellow&rsquo;s
Episode in &ldquo;Christus&rdquo; by the same name. The
medi&aelig;val story is a very simple one. Prince Henry
of Hoheneck, stricken down with an incurable ailment,
after vainly seeking a remedy, is visited by
Lucifer disguised as a physician, who tempts him
to adopt a remedy prescribed by a doctor of Salerno;
namely, the blood of a maiden who will voluntarily
offer herself as a sacrifice. Elsie devotes her life to
the Prince, and they journey together to Salerno,
where her death must take place. Arrived at the
spot, the Prince, touched by her magnanimity,
entreats her to forego her purpose; but she insists
upon it, bids him farewell in the school, and enters
an inner apartment with Lucifer disguised as a friar.
Before the tragedy can be consummated, the Prince
bursts open the door, with the aid of his followers,
and rescues her. The pair return to the castle on
the Rhine, where of course the rapidly convalescing
Prince marries Elsie, and the story closes with
an epilogue reciting the discomfiture of Lucifer and
the triumph of good over evil.</p>
<p>Out of this material the composer has constructed
his work, eliminating from and adding to the original
matter to suit his musical scheme, but at the same
time preserving the general spirit of the story. After
a very spirited and energetic prelude, the prologue
<span class="pb" id="pg_111">[111]</span>
begins with the fruitless attempt of Lucifer to pull
down the cross on the spire of Strasburg cathedral,
the protests of the spirits of the air (first and second
sopranos), the defiance of the bells (male chorus) as
each attempt fails, and the final disappearance of
the spirits amid the chanting of the majestic Latin
hymn, &ldquo;Nocte surgentes,&rdquo; by full chorus in the
church, accompanied by the organ. The second
scene opens in Prince Henry&rsquo;s chamber in the
tower of the Vautsberg castle, and reminds one of
the opening scene of &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; as set by Gounod.
After an expressive declamation of his melancholy
and his longing for rest and health (&ldquo;I cannot sleep,
my fervid Brain calls up the vanished Past again&rdquo;),
Lucifer appears in a flash of light, dressed as a travelling
physician, and a dialogue ensues, the purport of
which has already been told, which closes with an
ingenious and beautifully-written number for the two
voices, accompanied by a four-part chorus of mixed
voices and a small semi-chorus of sopranos and altos
(&ldquo;Golden Visions wave and hover&rdquo;). The fourth
scene is an unaccompanied quartet, &ldquo;The Evening
Song,&rdquo; sung by Elsie, Bertha, Max, and Gottlieb in
their peasant home in the Odenwald, as they light
the lamps (&ldquo;O gladsome Light of the Father&rdquo;).
It is a simple, tranquil hymn, but full of that sacred
sentiment which this composer expresses so admirably
in music. The fifth scene, Elsie&rsquo;s prayer in her
chamber (&ldquo;My Redeemer and my Lord&rdquo;), in its
calm beauty and religious feeling makes a fitting
pendant to the quartet. In the next number, the
<span class="pb" id="pg_112">[112]</span>
orchestra is utilized to carry on the action, and in
march tempo describes the pilgrimage to Salerno
with stately intervals, in which is heard the sacred
song, &ldquo;Urbs c&oelig;lestis, urbs beata,&rdquo; supposed to be
sung by the pilgrims &ldquo;moving slowly on their long
journey with uncovered feet.&rdquo; The seventh scene
is laid in the refectory of the convent of Hirschau,
in the Black Forest, where Lucifer enters the gaudiolum
of monks, disguised as a friar, and sings
the rollicking Latin drinking-song, &ldquo;Ave color vini
clari,&rdquo; which Mr. Edmund C. Stedman versified
for this work as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hail! thou vintage clear and ruddy!</p>
<p class="t0">Sweet of taste and fine of body,</p>
<p class="t0">Through thine aid we soon shall study</p>
<p class="t2">How to make us glorious!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Oh! thy color erubescent!</p>
<p class="t0">Oh! thy fragrance evanescent!</p>
<p class="t0">Oh! within the mouth how pleasant!</p>
<p class="t2">Thou the tongue&rsquo;s pr&aelig;torius!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Blest the stomach where thou wendest!</p>
<p class="t0">Blest the throat which thou distendest!</p>
<p class="t0">Blest the mouth which thou befriendest,</p>
<p class="t2">And the lips victorious!</p>
</div>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">Chorus of Monks.</span></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;Pour the wine, then, pour it!</p>
<p class="t2">Let the wave bear all before it!</p>
<p class="t2">There&rsquo;s none to score it,</p>
<p class="t2">So pour it in plenty, pour it!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The next number is for orchestra only, and once
more the instruments are used for a continuance of
the action by a description of the carousal of the
<span class="pb" id="pg_113">[113]</span>
monks in a characteristic allegro bacchanale, the
abbot testifying his indignation through the medium
of the trombone and the use of the Gregorian
melody. The sentiment of the latter is
expressed by the following verse:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What mean this revel and carouse?</p>
<p class="t0">Is this a tavern and drinking-house?</p>
<p class="t0">Are you Christian monks or heathen devils,</p>
<p class="t0">To pollute this convent with your revels?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The ninth scene changes to Genoa. Elsie, on a terrace
overlooking the sea, sings a charming aria (&ldquo;The
Night is calm and cloudless&rdquo;), with a choral refrain
of &ldquo;Kyrie Eleison.&rdquo; The tenth is a graceful barcarolle
for orchestra, but it is somewhat in the
nature of an interpolation, and is only connected
with the movement of the story by a thin thread,
as will be seen from the verse which gives its
motive:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The fisherman who lies afloat,</p>
<p class="t0">With shadowy sail in yonder boat,</p>
<p class="t0">Is singing softly to the night.</p>
<p class="t">A single step and all is o&rsquo;er;</p>
<p class="t0">And thou, dear Elsie, wilt be free</p>
<p class="t0">From martyrdom and agony.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The eleventh scene is a spirited and beautifully-written
male chorus of sailors (&ldquo;The Wind upon
our Quarter lies&rdquo;). The twelfth reaches the climax
in the scene at the college of Salerno between
Lucifer, Elsie, and the Prince, with accompaniment
of attendants, and is very dramatic throughout. It
is followed by a tender love-duet for Elsie and the
Prince on the terrace of the castle of Vautsberg,
<span class="pb" id="pg_114">[114]</span>
which leads to the epilogue, &ldquo;O Beauty of Holiness,&rdquo;
for full chorus and orchestra, in which the
composer is at his very best both in the construction
of the vocal parts and the elaborately worked-up
accompaniments.</p>
</div>
<div id="c032" title="The Voyage of Columbus">
<h4>The Voyage of Columbus.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Voyage of Columbus&rdquo; was written in 1885,
and first published in Germany. The text of the
libretto was prepared by the composer himself, extracts
from Washington Irving&rsquo;s &ldquo;Columbus&rdquo; forming
the theme of each of the six scenes, all of which
are supposed to transpire at evening, and are therefore
styled by the composer &ldquo;night-scenes.&rdquo; Their
arrangement, which is very skilfully accomplished,
is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Scene I.</span> In the chapel of St. George at Palos,
Aug. 2, 1492. &ldquo;The squadron being ready to put
to sea, Columbus, with his officers and crew, confessed
themselves to the friar, Juan Perez. They
entered upon the enterprise full of awe, committing
themselves to the especial guidance and protection
of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Scene II.</span> On the deck of the Santa Maria.
&ldquo;Eighteen years elapsed after Columbus conceived
his enterprise before he was enabled to carry it
into effect. The greater part of that time was
passed in almost hopeless solicitation, poverty,
and ridicule.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_115">[115]</div>
<p><span class="sc">Scene III.</span> The Vesper Hymn. &ldquo;In the evening,
according to the invariable custom on board
the admiral&rsquo;s ship, the mariners sang the Vesper
Hymn to the Virgin.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Scene IV.</span> Discontent and Mutiny. &ldquo;In this
way they fed each other&rsquo;s discontent, gathering into
little knots, and fomenting a spirit of mutinous opposition
... finally breaking forth into turbulent
clamor.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Scene V.</span> In distant Andalusia. &ldquo;He compares
the pure and balmy mornings to those of April in
Andalusia, and observes that they wanted but the
song of the nightingale to complete the illusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Scene VI.</span> Land and Thanksgiving. &ldquo;As the
evening darkened, Columbus took his station on
the top of the castle or cabin, on the high poop of
his vessel, ranging his eye along the horizon, and
maintaining an intense and unremitting watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cantata opens with a brief orchestral prelude
of a sombre character begun by the trombone
sounding the Gregorian intonation, and leading to
the barytone solo of the priest (&ldquo;Ye men of Spain,
the Time is nigh&rdquo;), appealing to the crew to commit
themselves to Heaven, to which the full male
chorus responds with ever-increasing power, reaching
the climax in the &ldquo;Ora pro nobis.&rdquo; Twice the
priest repeats his adjuration, followed by the choral
response, the last time with joy and animation as
the flag of Castile is raised and they bid farewell
to the shores of Spain. A short allegro brings
the scene to a close.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_116">[116]</div>
<p>The second scene is a bass aria for Columbus
(&ldquo;Eighteen long Years of Labor, Doubt, and Scorn&rdquo;),
of a vigorous and spirited character, changing to a
solemn adagio in the prayer, &ldquo;Lord of all Power and
Might,&rdquo; and closing with a few spirited phrases in
the opening tempo. It is followed by the Vesper
Hymn, &ldquo;Ave Maris Stella,&rdquo; a number in which
the composer&rsquo;s eminent ability in sacred music is
clearly shown. Its tranquil harmony dies away in
the softest of pianissimos, and is followed by an
agitated prelude introducing the furious chorus of
the mutinous crew &ldquo;Come, Comrades, come,&rdquo; which
gathers intensity as it progresses, voices and instruments
uniting in broken but powerful phrases,
sometimes in full chorus and again in solo parts,
until the climax is reached, when Columbus intervenes
in brief solos of great dignity, to which the
chorus responds, the scene closing with the renewal
of allegiance,&mdash;a stirring bass solo with choral accompaniment.</p>
<p>The fifth scene is a tenor recitative and love-song
of a most graceful character, and one which
will become a favorite when it is well known:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In Andalusia the nightingale</p>
<p class="t0">Sings,&mdash;sings through the live-long night;</p>
<p class="t0">Sings to its mate in pure delight:</p>
<p class="t2">But, ah me! ah, my love!</p>
<p class="t0">Vanished and lost to my sight</p>
<p class="t2">In distant Andalusia.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The final scene is very elaborate in its construction,
and brings the work to a sonorous and stately
<span class="pb" id="pg_117">[117]</span>
close. It opens with a very dramatic recitative by
Columbus (&ldquo;The Night is dark, but many a Sign
seen through this Day proclaims the Goal at Hand&rdquo;),
at the close of which there is a short orchestral prelude,
which serves to introduce a trio (&ldquo;Here at
your Bidding&rdquo;) for Columbus and two officers (first
tenor and first bass). At the cry of a seaman, &ldquo;Land
ho!&rdquo; the chorus responds with animation. Columbus
bids his crew join him &ldquo;in prayer and grateful
praise.&rdquo; The answer comes in a splendidly-written
&ldquo;Hallelujah,&rdquo; which is fairly majestic in its progression,
reaching its close in full broad harmony,
with the accompanying strains of trumpets.</p>
</div>
<div id="c033" title="The Light of Asia">
<h4>The Light of Asia.</h4>
<p>Mr. Buck&rsquo;s latest cantata, &ldquo;The Light of Asia,&rdquo;
well-nigh reaches the dimensions of an opera or
oratorio. It was written in 1886 and first published
in England. Its name reveals its source, and the
composer has made compensation for the privilege
of using Mr. Edwin Arnold&rsquo;s beautiful poem,
by a graceful dedication of the work to him. The
libretto was prepared by the composer himself, who
has shown great skill in making his selections in such
manner as not to disturb the continuity of the story.
The purely philosophical portions are omitted, and
only those are retained which have a human interest.
In this manner he has avoided the obstacle
which the lack of human sympathy in the poem,
beautiful as it is, would otherwise have placed in
<span class="pb" id="pg_118">[118]</span>
his way. The text, as will be remembered, has no
definite metre, much of it being in blank verse, and
does not readily lend itself to musical expression;
but it will be conceded that the composer has
also overcome this difficulty in a very remarkable
manner. The cantata is divided into four parts,&mdash;Prologue,
the Renunciation and Temptation, the
Return, and Epilogue and Finale.</p>
<p>The first part has nine numbers. A brief prelude
leads to the opening chorus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Below the highest sphere four regents sit,</p>
<p class="t0">Who rule the world; and under them are zones</p>
<p class="t0">Nearer, but high, where saintliest spirits dead,</p>
<p class="t0">Wait thrice ten thousand years, then live again.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It begins with a fugue, opened by the basses,
simple in its construction but stately in theme and
very dignified throughout. It is followed by a
bass solo of descriptive character (&ldquo;The King gave
Order that his Town should keep high Festival&rdquo;),
closing with a few choral measures, <i>sotto voce</i>, relating
that the King had ordered a festival in honor
of the advent of Buddha, and how a venerable saint,
Asita, recognized the divinity of the child and
&ldquo;the sacred primal signs,&rdquo; and foretold his mission.
The third number is the description of the young
Sidd&acirc;rtha, set in graceful recitative and semi-chorus
for female voices, with a charming accompaniment.
The fourth is a spring song (&ldquo;O come and see the
Pleasance of the Spring&rdquo;), begun by tenors and basses
and then developing into full chorus with animated
descriptive effects for the orchestra, picturing &ldquo;the
<span class="pb" id="pg_119">[119]</span>
thickets rustling with small life,&rdquo; the rippling waters
among the palms, the blue doves&rsquo; cooings, the jungles
laughing with the nesting-songs, and the far-off
village drums beating for marriage feasts. A recitative
for bass (&ldquo;Bethink ye, O my Ministers&rdquo;), in
which the King counsels with his advisers as to the
training of the child, leads to a four-part song for
tenors and basses (&ldquo;Love will cure these thin Distempers&rdquo;),
in which they urge him to summon a
court of pleasure in which the young prince may
award prizes to the fair. Then</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t12">&ldquo;If one or two</p>
<p class="t0">Change the fixed sadness of his tender cheek,</p>
<p class="t0">So may we choose for love with love&rsquo;s own eye.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The King orders the festival, and in the next number&mdash;a
march and animated three-part chorus for
female voices&mdash;Kapilavastu&rsquo;s maidens flock to the
gate, &ldquo;each with her dark hair newly smoothed and
bound.&rdquo; Then comes the recognition, briefly told
in soprano recitative. Yas&ocirc;dhara passes, and &ldquo;at
sudden sight of her he changed.&rdquo; A beautiful love-duet
for soprano and tenor (&ldquo;And their Eyes mixed,
and from the Look sprang Love&rdquo;) closes the scene.
The next number is a bass solo narrating the triumph
of Sidd&acirc;rtha over all other suitors, leading to a jubilant
and graceful wedding chorus (&ldquo;Enter, thrice-happy!
enter, thrice-desired!&rdquo;), the words of which
are taken from the &ldquo;Indian Song of Songs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second part opens with a soprano solo describing
his pleasure with Yas&ocirc;dhara, in the midst of
which comes the warning of the Devas:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_120">[120]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We are the voices of the wandering wind,</p>
<p class="t0">That moan for rest and rest can never find.</p>
<p class="t0">Lo! as the wind is, so is mortal life,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">A moan, a sigh, a sob, a storm, a strife.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This number is a semi-chorus, set for female voices,
interspersed with brief phrases for tenor, and after a
bass solo, relating the King&rsquo;s dream and the hermit&rsquo;s
interpretation, which induces him to doubly guard
Sidd&acirc;rtha&rsquo;s pleasure-house, leads up to a beautiful
chorus, divided between two sopranos, alto, two
tenors, and two basses:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Softly the Indian night sunk o&rsquo;er the plain,</p>
<p class="t0">Fragrant with blooms and jewelled thick with stars,</p>
<p class="t0">And cool with mountain airs sighing adown</p>
<p class="t0">From snow-flats on Him&acirc;la high outspread.</p>
<p class="t0">The moon above the eastern peaks</p>
<p class="t0">Silvered the roof-tops of the pleasure-house,</p>
<p class="t0">And all the sleeping land.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The next scene opens with a soprano solo (&ldquo;Within
the Bower of inmost Splendor&rdquo;), in which
Yas&ocirc;dhara relates her dream of the voice crying
&ldquo;The Time is nigh,&rdquo; to Sidd&acirc;rtha, and closes with
a tender duet for soprano and tenor. The next
number is a brief chorus (&ldquo;Then in her Tears she
slept&rdquo;), followed by the tenor solo, &ldquo;I will depart,&rdquo;
in which Sidd&acirc;rtha proclaims his resolve
&ldquo;to seek deliverance and the unknown light,&rdquo; and
leading to a richly-colored and majestic chorus:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There came a wind which lulled each sense aswoon</p>
<p class="t0">Of captains and of soldiers:</p>
<p class="t0">The gates of triple brass rolled back all silently</p>
<p class="t0">On their grim hinges;</p>
<p class="t0">Then, lightly treading, where those sleepers lay,</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_121">[121]</div>
<p class="t0">Into the night Sidd&acirc;rtha passed,</p>
<p class="t0">While o&rsquo;er the land a tremor spread,</p>
<p class="t0">As if earth&rsquo;s soul beneath stirred with an unknown hope,</p>
<p class="t0">And rich celestial music thrilled the air</p>
<p class="t0">From hosts on hosts of shining ones.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A tenor solo describes the six long years of wandering,
followed by a characteristic chorus of voices
of earth and air bidding him pass to the tree under
whose leaves it was foretold that truth should come
to him for the saving of the world. A short bass
recitative leads to a vigorous descriptive chorus
relating the temptations of Sidd&acirc;rtha, in which
the orchestra is used with masterly effect. A brief
soprano solo, the apparition of Yas&ocirc;dhara among
the wanton shapes floating about the tree, imploring
him to return, and the tenor response, bidding the
shadow depart, intervene; and then the chorus resumes
with increased vigor, reaching a furious climax
as the legions of hell tempt him, but dying away in
the close to phrases of tender beauty:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Radiant, rejoicing, strong, Buddha arose,</p>
<p class="t0">And far and near there spread an unknown peace.</p>
<p class="t0">As that divinest daybreak lightened earth,</p>
<p class="t0">The world was glad.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The third part (the Return) opens with a soprano
solo of a slow and mournful character, relating the
sorrow of Yas&ocirc;dhara and the visit of her damsels,
who announce the arrival of merchants with tidings
of Sidd&acirc;rtha. They are summoned, and tell their
story in a short chorus, which is followed by a brief
soprano solo (&ldquo;Uprose Yas&ocirc;dhara with Joy&rdquo;), an exultant
chorus (&ldquo;While the Town rang with Music&rdquo;),
<span class="pb" id="pg_122">[122]</span>
and another brief phrase for soprano, leading to a
fine choral outburst (&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis he! Sidd&acirc;rtha, who was
lost&rdquo;). The next number, a bass solo describing
the King&rsquo;s wrath when he learns that Sidd&acirc;rtha has
returned as a yellow-robed hermit instead of with
&ldquo;shining spears and tramp of horse and foot,&rdquo; is
very sonorous as well as dramatic, and is followed
by a tenor and bass dialogue developing into a trio
of great beauty (&ldquo;Thus passed the Three into the
Way of Peace&rdquo;). The final number is a masterpiece
of choral work both in the elaborateness of its
construction and the majesty of its effect, and brings
the cantata to a close with the mystic words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Dew is on the Lotus! Rise, great Sun!</p>
<p class="t0">And lift my leaf and mix it with the wave.</p>
<p class="t0">The Sunrise comes! the Sunrise comes!</p>
<p class="t0">The Dewdrop slips into the shining sea.</p>
<p class="t3">Hail, High Deliverer, Hail!&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CORDER.</h3>
<p>Frederick Corder, the English composer
and conductor, was born at Hackney,
London, Jan. 26, 1852. He was a
student at the Royal Academy of Music
in 1874, and in the following year gained the Mendelssohn
scholarship. From 1875 to 1878 he studied
at Cologne with Hiller, and in 1879 returned
to London, where he engaged for a time in literary
pursuits. His abilities as a writer are very clearly
shown in the librettos to his works. In 1880 he
was appointed conductor of the orchestra at the
Brighton Aquarium, and since that time he has
devoted himself to teaching and composition. His
principal works are &ldquo;In the Black Forest,&rdquo; an
orchestral suite, and &ldquo;Evening on the Seashore,&rdquo;
idyl for orchestra (1876); the opera &ldquo;Morte
d&rsquo;Arthur&rdquo; (1877); the one-act opera &ldquo;Philomel&rdquo;
(1879); cantata, &ldquo;The Cyclops&rdquo; (1880); &ldquo;Ossian,&rdquo;
a concert overture for orchestra, produced by the
London Philharmonic Society (1882); the cantata
&ldquo;Bridal of Triermain&rdquo; (1886); and the opera
&ldquo;Nordisa,&rdquo; founded upon a Norwegian subject and
<span class="pb" id="pg_124">[124]</span>
brought out with great success in January, 1887 by
the Carl Rosa opera troupe. Mr. Corder is one
of the most ambitious and promising of all the
younger English composers, and his music shows in
a special degree the influence of Wagner. That he
has also literary talent of a high order is evinced by
his contributions to periodical literature and the
librettos of his last two works,&mdash;&ldquo;The Bridal of
Triermain&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nordisa.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div id="c035" title="The Bridal of Triermain">
<h4>The Bridal of Triermain.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Bridal of Triermain&rdquo; was written for the
Wolverhampton (England) Festival of 1886, and was
one of the most notable successes in the festival
performances of that year. The subject is taken
from Walter Scott&rsquo;s poem of the same name. The
adaptation has been made in a very free manner, but
the main incidents of the poem have been carefully
preserved. Sir Roland&rsquo;s vision of the &ldquo;Maid of
Middle Earth;&rdquo; the bard Lyulph&rsquo;s recital of the
Arthurian legend, which tells of Gyneth&rsquo;s enchantment
in the valley of St. John by Merlin, where she
must sleep</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Until a knight shall wake thee</p>
<p class="t0">For feats of arms as far renowned</p>
<p class="t0">As warrior of the Table Round;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>the magic wrought by Merlin in the valley to delude
Roland and thwart his effort to rescue Gyneth; his
daring entrance into the palace grounds; the discovery
<span class="pb" id="pg_125">[125]</span>
of the Princess in the enchanted hall, and
her final rescue are the themes which the composer
has treated. In arranging his libretto he has, as has
been said, made a free adaptation of the poem,
sometimes using verses entire, at other times changing
the text and rearranging it to suit the composer&rsquo;s
musical demands, even at the expense of the original
beauty and symmetry of the work.</p>
<p>The cantata has no overture, but opens with a
choral introduction (&ldquo;Where is the Maiden of Mortal
Strain?&rdquo;). An orchestral interlude in the form
of a tender graceful nocturne follows, leading up to
the tenor solo, &ldquo;The Dawn of an autumn Day did
creep,&rdquo; in which the Baron relates the apparition
he has seen in his dream. A short bass recitative
by Lyulph the bard introduces the Legend, which
is told in an effective number for soprano solo, bass
solo, and chorus (&ldquo;In Days e&rsquo;en Minstrels now
forget&rdquo;). The next number, a very dramatic dialogue
for soprano and tenor, gives us the conversation
between Arthur and Gyneth, and leads to an
energetic full chorus with very descriptive accompaniment,
picturing the bloody tourney and its
sudden interruption by the appearance of Merlin
the enchanter. The first part closes with a charming
number (&ldquo;&lsquo;Madmen,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;your Strife forbear&rsquo;&rdquo;)
arranged for bass solo, quartet, and chorus,
in which is described the spell which Merlin casts
upon Gyneth.</p>
<p>The second part, after a short allegro movement
for orchestra, opens with a contralto solo (&ldquo;Of
<span class="pb" id="pg_126">[126]</span>
wasted Fields and plundered Flocks&rdquo;) which prepares
the way for a concerted number for solos and
chorus (&ldquo;And now the Moon her Orb has hid&rdquo;),
describing the magical arts which Merlin employed
to thwart the Baron. This number alone is sufficient
to stamp Mr. Corder as a composer of extraordinary
ability. A succession of bass, tenor, and
contralto recitatives (&ldquo;Wroth waxed the Warrior&rdquo;)
leads to another powerful chorus (&ldquo;Rash Adventurer,
bear thee back&rdquo;), the song of the &ldquo;four
maids whom Afric bore,&rdquo; in which the composer
has caught the weird, strange color of the scene
and given it vivid expression. A tenor recitative
(&ldquo;While yet the distant Echoes roll&rdquo;) leads up to
a graceful, sensuous soprano solo and female chorus
(&ldquo;Gentle Knight, awhile delay&rdquo;). Its counterpart
is found in the tenor recitative and spirited,
dignified male chorus (&ldquo;Son of Honor, Theme of
Story&rdquo;). The <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> now begins. A contralto
solo, declamatory in style (&ldquo;In lofty Hall,
with Trophies graced&rdquo;), and a short soprano solo
of a joyous character (&ldquo;Thus while she sang&rdquo;)
lead to the final number (&ldquo;Gently, lo! the Warrior
kneels&rdquo;), beginning with full chorus, which after
short solos for tenor and soprano takes a spirited
martial form (&ldquo;And on the Champion&rsquo;s Brow was
found&rdquo;) and closes with a quartet and chorus
worked up to an imposing climax.</p>
<p>The work is largely in narrative form; but this,
instead of being a hindrance, seems to have been
an advantage to the composer, who has not failed
<span class="pb" id="pg_127">[127]</span>
to invest his music with dramatic force that is remarkable.
Mr. Corder is credited with being an
ardent disciple of Wagner, and his cantata certainly
shows the influences of that school. It is throughout
a vigorous, effective work, and gives promise
that its composer will yet be heard from outside the
English musical world.</p>

<h3>COWEN.</h3>
<p>Frederic H. Cowen, the favorite English
song-writer, was born at Kingston,
Jamaica, Jan. 29, 1852, and went to
England at a very early age. His first
teachers were Benedict and Sir J. Goss, with whom
he studied until 1865. During the next three years
he continued his musical education at the conservatories
of Leipsic and Berlin, returning to England
in 1868. His earlier works were an operetta called
&ldquo;Garibaldi,&rdquo; a fantasie-sonata and piano concerto,
a few pieces of chamber music, and a symphony in
C minor. These served to introduce him to public
notice, and since that time nearly all of his works
have met with remarkable success, among them
&ldquo;The Rose Maiden&rdquo; (1870); music to Schiller&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Joan of Arc&rdquo; (1871); festival overture (1872);
&ldquo;The Corsair,&rdquo; composed for the Birmingham Festival
of 1876; a symphony in F major and the
Norwegian symphony, which have been favorably
received in this country. His most important opera
is &ldquo;Pauline,&rdquo; which was produced in London with
great success by the Carl Rosa company, Nov. 22,
<span class="pb" id="pg_129">[129]</span>
1876. As a song-writer, Mr. Cowen is also well
known; many of his lyrics, especially those written
for Antoinette Sterling and Mrs. E. Aline Osgood,
the American singers, having obtained a wide-spread
popularity.</p>
</div>
<div id="c037" title="The Sleeping Beauty">
<h4>The Sleeping Beauty.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Sleeping Beauty,&rdquo; written for the Birmingham
Festival of 1885, the poem by Francis Hueffer,
has for its theme the well-known fairy tale which
has been so often illustrated in music and upon
canvas. It is a great favorite in England, and has
also met with a successful reception in Paris, where
it was brought out not long since by the Concordia
Society of that city, under the title of &ldquo;La Belle au
Bois Dormant,&rdquo; the translation having been made
by Miss Augusta Holmes, herself a musician of
considerable repute.</p>
<p>After a brief orchestral introduction, a three-part
chorus (altos, tenors, and basses) tells the story of
the ancient King to whom an heiress was born
when all hope of offspring had been abandoned, the
gay carousal which he ordered, and the sudden appearance
of the twelve fays, guardians of his house,
with their spinning-wheels and golden flax, who sing
as they weave:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Draw the thread and weave the woof</p>
<p class="t0">For the little child&rsquo;s behoof:</p>
<p class="t0">Future, dark to human eyes,</p>
<p class="t0">Openly before us lies;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_130">[130]</div>
<p class="t0">As we will and as we give,</p>
<p class="t0">Haply shall the maiden live;</p>
<p class="t0">Draw the thread and weave the woof</p>
<p class="t0">For the little child&rsquo;s behoof.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In beauty of melody and gracefulness of orchestration
this chorus of the fays is specially noticeable.
Its charming movement, however, is interrupted by
a fresh passage for male chorus, of an agitated character,
describing the entrance of the Wicked Fay,
who bends over the cradle of the child and sings a
characteristic contralto aria:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;From the gold of the flaxen reel</p>
<p class="t0">Threads of bliss have been spun to thee;</p>
<p class="t0">By the whirl of the spinning wheel</p>
<p class="t0">Cruel grief shall be done to thee.</p>
<p class="t0">Thy fate I descry:</p>
<p class="t0">Ere the buds of thy youth are blown,</p>
<p class="t0">Ere a score of thy years have flown,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou shalt prick thy hand, thou shalt die.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Following this aria, the male chorus has a few
measures, invoking a curse upon the Fay, which
leads to a full chorus of an animated character, foretelling
that there shall dawn a day when a young
voice, more powerful than witchcraft, will save her;
at the close of which the guardian fays are again
heard drawing the thread and weaving the woof in
low, murmuring tones, with a spinning accompaniment.
It is followed by a trio (soprano, tenor, and
bass), with chorus accompaniment, announcing the
departure of the fays, and leading to a very melodious
tenor solo, with two graceful orchestral interludes,
which moralizes on what has occurred and
closes the prologue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_131">[131]</div>
<p>The first scene opens in a hall in the King&rsquo;s palace,
and is full of animation. A brilliant orchestral
prelude leads to the full chorus in waltz time (&ldquo;At
Dawn of Day on the first of May&rdquo;), which moves
along with a fascinating swing, and closes in a very
vigorous climax. At this point the King makes
his appearance and expresses his joy that the time
has passed when the prophecy of the Wicked Fay
could take effect, for this is the Princess&rsquo;s twentieth
birthday. A dialogue follows between the King
and his daughter, closing with a beautiful chorus
(&ldquo;Pure as thy Heart&rdquo;), after which the dance-music
resumes. Unobserved the Princess leaves
the banqueting-hall, glides along a gallery, and ascends
the staircase to a turret chamber. Before she
enters she sings an aria, of a tranquil, dreamy nature
(&ldquo;Whither away, my Heart?&rdquo;), and interwoven with
it are heard the gradually lessening strains of the
dance-music, which ceases altogether as her song
comes to an almost inaudible close.</p>
<p>The second scene opens in the turret chamber,
where the Wicked Fay, disguised as an old crone,
is spinning. After a short dialogue, in which the
Fay explains to the Princess the use of the wheel,
she bids her listen, and sings a weird ballad (&ldquo;As I
sit at my Spinning-wheel, strange Dreams come to
me&rdquo;), closing with the refrain of the old prophecy,
&ldquo;Ere the Buds of her Youth are blown.&rdquo; The
Princess dreamily repeats the burden of the song,
and then, fearing the presence of some ill-omen,
opens the door to escape. She hears the dance-music
<span class="pb" id="pg_132">[132]</span>
again, but the Fay gently draws her back
and induces her to touch the flax. As she does so,
the Fay covertly pricks her finger with the spindle.
She swoons away, the dance-music suddenly stops,
and there is a long silence, broken at last by the
Fay&rsquo;s triumphant declaration: &ldquo;Thus have I
wrought my Vengeance.&rdquo; The next number is
the Incantation Music (&ldquo;Spring from the Earth,
red Roses&rdquo;), a very dramatic declamation, sung by
the Fay and interwoven with snatches of chorus
and the refrain of the prophecy. A choral interlude
(&ldquo;Sleep in Bower and Hall&rdquo;) follows, describing
in a vivid manner, both with voices and
instruments, the magic sleep that fell upon the
castle and all its inmates, and the absence of all
apparent life save the spiders weaving their webs
on the walls as the years go by:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The spells of witchcraft which enthrall</p>
<p class="t0">Each sleeper in that desolate hall,</p>
<p class="t0">Who can break them?</p>
<p class="t0">Say, who can lift the deathly blight</p>
<p class="t0">That covers king and lord and knight,</p>
<p class="t0">To give them back to life and light,</p>
<p class="t0">And awake them?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The answer comes in an animated prelude, through
which is heard the strain of a horn signal, constantly
growing louder, and heralding the Prince, who enters
the silent palace, sword in hand, among the sleeping
courtiers, knights, and ladies. After a vigorous declamation
(&ldquo;Light, Light at last&rdquo;) he passes on his
way to the turret chamber, where he beholds the
sleeping Princess. The love-song which follows
<span class="pb" id="pg_133">[133]</span>
(&ldquo;Kneeling before Thee, worshipping wholly&rdquo;) is
one of the most effective portions of the work.
His kiss awakes her, and as she springs up, the
dance-music at once resumes from the bar where
it had stopped in the scene with the Wicked Fay.
An impassioned duet follows, and the work closes
with the animated waltz-chorus which opened the
first scene.</p>

<h3>DVO&#344;&Aacute;K.</h3>
<p>Anton Dvo&#345;&aacute;k, the Bohemian composer
who has risen so suddenly into
prominence, was born at M&uuml;lhausen, near
Prague, Sept. 8, 1841. His father combined
the business of tavern-keeper and butcher,
and young Dvo&#345;&aacute;k assisted him in waiting upon customers,
as well as in the slaughtering business. As
the laws of Bohemia stipulate that music shall be a
part of common-school education, Dvo&#345;&aacute;k learned
the rudiments in the village school, and also received
violin instruction. At the age of thirteen he went
to work for an uncle, who resided in the village
where the schoolmaster was a proficient musician.
The latter, recognizing his ability, gave him lessons
on the organ, and allowed him to copy music.
Piano lessons followed, and he had soon grounded
himself quite thoroughly in counterpoint. At the
age of sixteen he was admitted to the organ-school
of Prague, of which Joseph Pitsch was the principal.
Pitsch died soon after, and was succeeded by
Kreyci, who made Dvo&#345;&aacute;k acquainted with the
music of Mozart, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn.
<span class="pb" id="pg_135">[135]</span>
The first orchestral work he heard was Beethoven&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ninth Symphony,&rdquo; during its rehearsal under
Spohr&rsquo;s direction. In 1860, being then in his
nineteenth year, he obtained an engagement, with
the meagre salary of one hundred and twenty-five
dollars a year, as violinist in a band that played at
caf&eacute;s and dances. Two years later he secured a
position in the Bohemian Opera House at Prague,
then under the direction of Mayer, where he remained
until 1871, in which year he left the theatre
and devoted himself to teaching, with the prospect
of earning two hundred and fifty dollars a year.
These were hard days for the young musician; but
while he was there struggling for a bare subsistence,
he continued writing compositions, though he had
no prospect of selling them or of having them
played. About this time he wrote his &ldquo;Patriotic
Hymn&rdquo; and the opera &ldquo;K&ouml;nig und K&ouml;hler.&rdquo; The
latter was rejected after an orchestral trial; but he
continued his work, undaunted by failure. Shortly
after this he received the appointment of organist at
the Adelbert Church, Prague, and fortune began to
smile upon him. His Symphony in F was laid before
the Minister of Instruction in Vienna, and upon the
recommendation of Herbeck secured him a grant of
two hundred dollars. When Brahms replaced Herbeck
on the committee which reported upon artists&rsquo;
stipends, he fully recognized Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s ability, and
not only encouraged him, but also brought him
before the world by securing him a publisher and
commending him to Joachim, who still further advanced
<span class="pb" id="pg_136">[136]</span>
his interests by securing performances of
his works in Germany and England. Since that
time he has risen rapidly, and is now recognized as
one of the most promising of living composers.
Among his works which have been produced during
the past few years are the &ldquo;Stabat Mater,&rdquo; the
cantata &ldquo;The Spectre&rsquo;s Bride,&rdquo; three operas in the
Czechist dialect, three orchestral symphonies, several
Slavonic rhapsodies, overtures, violin and piano
concertos, an exceedingly beautiful sextet, and numerous
songs.</p>
</div>
<div id="c039" title="The Spectre&rsquo;s Bride">
<h4>The Spectre&rsquo;s Bride.</h4>
<p>The legend of the Spectre&rsquo;s Bride is current in
various forms among all the Slavonic nations. The
Russians, Servians, Slovaks, Lithuanians, and Poles
all have poems in which the ghostly ride of the
spectre and the maiden forms the theme. The
German version, told by B&uuml;rger in his famous ballad
&ldquo;Lenore,&rdquo; is best known; and Raff has given it a
musical setting in his Lenore Symphony. In general,
the story is the same. The Spectre comes for his
Bride and she rides away with him through the
night, amid all manner of supernatural horrors,
only to find at the end that she has ridden to the
grave with a skeleton. The Bohemian poem used
by Dvo&#345;&aacute;k is that of Karel Jaromir Erben, a poet
who obtained a national fame by making collections
of the songs and legends of his country during his
<span class="pb" id="pg_137">[137]</span>
service as Secretary of the Royal Bohemian Museum
and Keeper of the Archives at Prague. In his version,
unlike the German, the Spectre and his Bride
make their grewsome journey on foot. The <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>
in the churchyard differs also, as the maiden
is saved by an appeal to the Virgin. In the opening
scene she is represented gazing at a picture of
the Virgin, mourning the death of her parents and
the absence of her lover, who has failed to keep his
promise to return. His parting words were:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sow flax, my love, I counsel thee,</p>
<p class="t0">And every day remember me.</p>
<p class="t0">Spin in the first year, spin with care,</p>
<p class="t0">Bleach in the next the fabric fair;</p>
<p class="t0">Then garments make, when the years are three,</p>
<p class="t0">And every day remember me.</p>
<p class="t0">Twine I that year a wreath for thee;</p>
<p class="t0">We two that year shall wedded be.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>She has faithfully followed the counsel. The three
years have expired, but still no tidings have come.
As she appeals to the Virgin to bring him back, the
picture moves, the flame of the lamp upleaps, there
is an ominous knock at the door, and the voice of
the apparition is heard urging her to cease praying
and follow him to his home. She implores him to
wait until the night is past, but the importunate
Spectre bids her go with him, and she consents. On
they speed over rough bowlders, through thorny
brakes and swamps, attended by the baying of
wolves, the screeching of owls, the croaking of frogs,
and the fitful glow of corpse-candles. One by one he
compels her to throw away her prayer-book, chaplet,
and cross, and resisting all her appeals to stop and
<span class="pb" id="pg_138">[138]</span>
rest, at last they reach the churchyard wall. He
calms her fears with the assurance that the church
is his castle and the yard his garden, and bids her
leap the wall with him. She promises to follow him,
but after he has cleared it, sudden fear seizes her;
she flies to a tiny house near by and enters. A
ghastly scene takes place; spectres are dancing before
the door, and the moonlight reveals to her a
corpse lying upon a plank. As she gazes, horror-stricken,
a knock is heard, and a voice bids the dead
arise and thrust the living one out. Thrice the
summons is repeated, and then as the corpse opens
its eyes and glares upon her, she prays once more
to the Virgin. At this instant the crowing of a cock
is heard. The dead man falls back, the ghastly,
spectral crew disappear, and night gives way to a
peaceful morning.</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;All who to Mass at morning went</p>
<p class="t0">Stood still in great astonishment;</p>
<p class="t0">One tomb there was to ruin gone,</p>
<p class="t0">And in the dead-house a maiden wan;</p>
<p class="t0">On looking round, amazed were they,</p>
<p class="t0">On every grave a garment lay.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Well was it, maiden, that thy mind</p>
<p class="t0">Turned unto God, defence to find,</p>
<p class="t0">For He thy foes did harmless bind;</p>

<p class="t0">Ill with thy soul it then had gone;</p>
<p class="t0">Thy body, as the garments were,</p>
<p class="t0">Mangled had been, and scattered there.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Such is the horrible story which forms the theme
of Dvo&#345;&aacute;k&rsquo;s cantata. It was written for the Birmingham
Festival of 1884, and the text was translated by
the Rev. Dr. Troutbeck, from a German translation
<span class="pb" id="pg_139">[139]</span>
of the original poem made by K. J. M&uuml;ller. It contains
eighteen numbers, each of considerable length,
of which eleven are descriptive, the barytone, with
chorus response, acting the part of the narrator, and
accompanied by instrumentation which vividly paints
the horrors of the nocturnal tramp, even to the
realistic extent of imitating the various sounds described.
It is unnecessary to specify each of these
numbers in detail, as they are all closely allied in
color and general effect. The music which accompanies
them is picturesque and weird, increasing in
its power and actual supernaturalism until it reaches
its climax in the dead-house where the maiden takes
refuge; and in these numbers the orchestra bears the
burden of the work. The remaining numbers are
almost magical in their beauty and fascination, particularly
the first song of the maiden, lamenting her
lover, and closing with the prayer to the Virgin,
which is thoroughly devotional music, and the second
prayer, which saves her from her peril. There are
four duets, soprano and tenor, between the Bride
and Spectre, and one with chorus, in which are recounted
the episodes of the chaplet, prayer-book, and
cross, besides the hurried dialogue between them
as he urges her on. These, too, abound in quaint
rhythms and strange harmonies set against a highly-colored
instrumental background. The story is not
a pleasant one for musical treatment,&mdash;at least for
voices,&mdash;and the prevailing tone of the composition
is sombre; but of the wonderful power of the music
and its strange fascination there can be no doubt.</p>

<h3>FOOTE.</h3>
<p>Arthur Foote, a rising young composer
of Boston, whose works have already
made more than a local reputation,
was born at Salem, Mass., March 5, 1853.
While at Harvard College he studied composition
with Prof. J. K. Paine, and after graduation determined
to devote himself to the musical profession.
He studied the piano-forte and organ with Mr.
B. J. Lang of Boston, and soon made his mark as
a musician of more than ordinary promise. Among
his published works which have attracted favorable
attention are various songs and piano compositions;
pieces for violin and piano, violoncello and piano;
a string quartet; trio for piano, violin, and violoncello;
and &ldquo;Hiawatha,&rdquo; a ballad for male voices
and orchestra. A suite for strings, in manuscript,
has obtained the honor of performance at the London
symphony concerts (January, 1887), and an
overture, &ldquo;In the Mountains,&rdquo; also in manuscript,
was played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in
February, 1887. He is now living in Boston,
where he is engaged in teaching the piano and
organ.</p>
</div>
<div id="c041" title="Hiawatha">
<div class="pb" id="pg_141">[141]</div>
<h4>Hiawatha.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Farewell of Hiawatha,&rdquo; for barytone solo,
male voices, and orchestra, modestly styled by its
composer a ballad, is a cantata in its lighter form.
Its subject is taken from Longfellow&rsquo;s familiar poem,
and includes the beautiful close of the legend beginning
with the stanza:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;From his place rose Hiawatha,</p>
<p class="t0">Bade farewell to old Nokomis,</p>
<p class="t0">Spake in whispers, spake in this wise,</p>
<p class="t0">Did not wake the guests, that slumbered.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The composer has made use of the remainder of
the poem without change, except in repetitions
demanded by musical necessity and in the omission
of the seven lines immediately preceding the final
words of farewell, which does not mar the context.
A short orchestral introduction, <i>andante con moto</i>,
followed by a chorus of tenors and basses in a few
bars, recitative in form and sung pianissimo, lead
to a barytone solo for Hiawatha (&ldquo;I am going,
O Nokomis&rdquo;) of a quiet and tender character. A
graceful phrase for the violoncello introduces another
choral morceau relating Hiawatha&rsquo;s farewell
to the warriors (&ldquo;I am going, O my People&rdquo;)
a melodious combination of sweetness and strength,
though it only rises to a display of energy in the
single phrase, &ldquo;The Master of Life has sent them,&rdquo;
after which it closes quietly, and tenderly, in keeping
with the sentiment of the text. The remainder of
the work is choral. The westward sail of Hiawatha
<span class="pb" id="pg_142">[142]</span>
into the &ldquo;fiery sunset,&rdquo; &ldquo;the purple vapors,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the dusk of evening&rdquo; is set to a very picturesque
accompaniment, which dies away in soft
strains as he disappears in the distance. An allegro
movement with a crescendo of great energy introduces
the farewell of &ldquo;the forests dark and
lonely,&rdquo; moving &ldquo;through all their depths of darkness,&rdquo;
of the waves &ldquo;rippling on the pebbles,&rdquo; and
of &ldquo;the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, from her haunts
among the fen-lands.&rdquo; The last division of the
chorus is an allegro, beginning pianissimo and closing
with an exultant outburst:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thus departed Hiawatha,</p>
<p class="t0">Hiawatha the Beloved,</p>
<p class="t0">In the glory of the sunset,</p>
<p class="t0">In the purple mists of evening,</p>
<p class="t0">To the regions of the home-wind,</p>
<p class="t0">Of the Northwest wind Keewaydin,</p>
<p class="t0">To the Islands of the Blessed,</p>
<p class="t0">To the kingdom of Ponemah,</p>
<p class="t0">To the land of the Hereafter!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The work, which was written for the Apollo Club
of Boston, is not a long one, nor is it at all ambitious
in style. The composer has evidently tried
to reflect the quiet and tender sentiment of the
farewell in his music, and has admirably succeeded.
Poetic beauty is its most striking feature, both in
the instrumental parts, which are well sustained, and
in the vocal, which are earnest, expressive, and at
times very pathetic, of this pretty tone-picture.</p>

<div class="img"><img src="images/p143.png" alt="" width="298" height="130" /></div>
<h3>GADE.</h3>
<p>Niels W. Gade was born at Copenhagen,
Oct. 22, 1817. His father was a musical-instrument
maker and intrusted his early
education to the Danish masters Wershall,
Berggren, and Weyse. He made such good
progress that he soon entered the royal orchestra
of that city as a violinist and began to be known as
a composer. His first important work, the overture
&ldquo;Nachkl&auml;nge von Ossian,&rdquo; obtained a prize
from the Copenhagen Musical Union and also
secured for him the favor of the King, who provided
him with the means for making a foreign journey.
Prior to starting he sent a copy of a symphony to
Mendelssohn, which met with the latter&rsquo;s enthusiastic
approval. He arrived at Leipsic in 1843, and
after producing his first symphony with success,
travelled through Italy, returning to Leipsic in 1844,
where during the winter of that year he conducted
the Gewandhaus concerts in the place of Mendelssohn,
who was absent in Berlin. In the season of
1845-46 he assisted Mendelssohn in the same concerts,
and after the latter&rsquo;s death became the principal
<span class="pb" id="pg_144">[144]</span>
director, a post which he held until 1848, when he
returned to Copenhagen and took a position as
organist, and also conducted the concerts of the
Musical Union. In 1861 he was appointed Hofcapellmeister,
and was honored with the title of
Professor of Music. Since that time he has devoted
himself to composition, and has produced
many excellent works, especially for festivals in
England and elsewhere. Among them are the cantatas
&ldquo;Comala,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spring Fantasie,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Erl King&rsquo;s
Daughter,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Holy Night,&rdquo; &ldquo;Spring&rsquo;s Message,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Crusaders,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Zion;&rdquo; the overtures
&ldquo;In the Highlands,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Michael
Angelo;&rdquo; seven symphonies, and a large number
of songs and piano pieces, as well as chamber-music
compositions.</p>
</div>
<div id="c043" title="Comala">
<h4>Comala.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Comala,&rdquo; one of the earliest of Gade&rsquo;s larger
vocal works, was first produced at Leipsic in March,
1843. Its subject is taken from Ossian, and relates
the tragedy of &ldquo;Comala,&rdquo; daughter of Sarno, King
of Innistore, who had conceived a violent passion
for Fingal, King of Morven. Her love is returned
by the warrior, and disguised as a youth the princess
follows him on his expedition against Caracul, King
of Lochlin. On the day of the battle Fingal places
her on a height, near the shore of the Carun, whence
she can overlook the fight, and promises her if
<span class="pb" id="pg_145">[145]</span>
victorious that he will return at evening. Comala,
though filled with strange forebodings, hopefully
waits her royal lover&rsquo;s coming. As the tedious
hours pass on a fearful storm arises, and amid the
howling of the blast the spirits of the fathers sweep
by her on their way to the battlefield to conduct to
their home the souls of the fallen,&mdash;the same majestic
idea which Wagner uses with such consummate
power in his weird ride of the Valkyries.
Comala imagines that the battle has been lost, and
overcome with grief falls to the ground and dies.
The victorious Fingal returns as evening approaches,
accompanied by the songs of his triumphant warriors,
only to hear the tidings of Comala&rsquo;s death from her
weeping maidens. Sorrowing he orders the bards
to chant her praises, and joining with her attendants
to waft her departing soul &ldquo;to the fathers&rsquo; dwelling&rdquo;
with farewell hymns.</p>
<p>The cantata is almost equally divided between
male and female choruses, and these are the charm
of the work. Many of the songs of Comala and her
maids are in graceful ballad form, fresh in their
melody, and marked by that peculiar refinement
which characterizes all of Gade&rsquo;s music. The parting
duet between Fingal and Comala is very beautiful,
but the principal interest centres in the choruses.
Those of the bards and warriors are very stately in
their style and abound in dramatic power, particularly
the one accompanying the triumphal return of
Fingal. The chorus of spirits is very impressive, and
in some passages almost supernatural. The female
<span class="pb" id="pg_146">[146]</span>
choruses, on the other hand, are graceful, tender, and
pathetic; the final full chorus, in which the bards
and maidens commend the soul of Comala to &ldquo;the
fathers&rsquo; dwelling,&rdquo; has rarely been surpassed in
beauty or pathos. The music of the cantata is in
keeping with the stately grandeur and richly-hued
tones of the Ossianic poem. The poetry and music
of the North are happily wedded.</p>
</div>
<div id="c044" title="Spring Fantasie">
<h4>Spring Fantasie.</h4>
<p>Though the &ldquo;Spring Fantasie&rdquo; is in undoubted
cantata form, Gade designates it as a &ldquo;Concertst&uuml;ck;&rdquo;
that is, a musical composition in which the
instrumental parts are essential to its complete unity.
Its origin is unquestionably to be found in the idea
of Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Choral Fantasie,&rdquo; which was subsequently
developed in the choral symphony on a
still larger and grander scale. The instrumental
elements of the &ldquo;Spring Fantasie&rdquo; are unquestionably
the most prominent. They do not play the
subordinate part of accompaniment, but really enunciate
the ideas of the poem, which are still further
illustrated by the voices, acting as the interpreters
of the meaning of the instrumentation.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Fantasie&rdquo; was written in 1850, its subject
being a poem by Edmund Lobedanz, which of itself
might appropriately be called a fantasy. The
work consists of four movements, for four solo
voices, orchestra, and piano-forte. The prominence
<span class="pb" id="pg_147">[147]</span>
which Gade has given to the instrumental parts is
shown by his characterizing the movements,&mdash;I.
<i>Allegro moderato e sostenuto</i>; II. <i>Allegro molto
e con fuoco</i>; III. <i>Allegro vivace</i>. The poem in the
original is one of more than ordinary excellence.
The translation in most common use is one made
by Mrs. Vander Weyde for a performance of the
work in London in 1878 at the Royal Normal College
and Academy of Music for the Blind, under the
direction of Herr von B&uuml;low.</p>
<p>The first movement is in the nature of an invocation
to spring, in which the longing for May and
its flowers is very tenderly expressed. The second
movement depicts with great vigor the return of the
wintry storms, the raging of the torrents, the gradual
rolling away of the clouds, the approach of more
genial breezes, and the rising of the star, typifying
&ldquo;the joy of a fair maiden&rsquo;s love.&rdquo; The closing
movement is full of rejoicing that the spring has
come. Voices and instruments share alike in the
jubilation:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For the spring-time has come, the May is here,</p>
<p class="t0">On hill and in vale all is full of delight.</p>
<p class="t0">How sweet is the spring-time, how lovely and bright,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Its kingdom is over us all.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c045" title="The Erl King&rsquo;s Daughter">
<h4>The Erl King&rsquo;s Daughter.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Erl King&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo; was written in 1852.
Its story differs from that told in Goethe&rsquo;s famous
<span class="pb" id="pg_148">[148]</span>
poem, and set to music equally famous by Schubert
in his familiar song. In Goethe&rsquo;s poem the father
rides through the night clasping his boy and followed
by the Erl King and his daughters, who
entice the child unseen by the parent. In vain he
assures him that the Erl King&rsquo;s voice is but the
&ldquo;sad wind sighing through the withered leaves,&rdquo;
that his train is but the mist, and that his daughters
are the aged gray willows deceiving his sight. The
boy at first is charmed with the apparition, but
cries in mortal terror as the Erl King seizes him,
while the father gallops at last into the courtyard,
only to find his child dead in his arms.</p>
<p>In the poem used by Gade it is the Erl King&rsquo;s
daughter who tempts a knight to his death. The
prologue relates that Sir Oluf at eve stayed his steed
and rested beneath the alders by the brook, where
he was visited by two of the daughters, one of whom
caressed him while the other invited him to join
their revels. At sound of the cock-crow, however,
they disappeared. It was the eve of Sir Oluf&rsquo;s
wedding day. He arrives home in a distraught
condition, and in spite of his mother&rsquo;s appeals decides
to return to the alder grove in quest of the
beauties who had bewitched him. He finds the
alder-maids dancing in the moonlight, singing and
beckoning him to join them. One of the fairest
tempts him with a silken gown for the bride and
silver armor for himself. When he refuses to dance
with her, she seizes him by the arm and predicts his
death on the morrow morning. &ldquo;Ride home to
<span class="pb" id="pg_149">[149]</span>
your bride in robe of red,&rdquo; she cries as he hastens
away. In the morning the mother anxiously waits
his coming, and at last beholds him riding desperately
through &ldquo;the waving corn.&rdquo; He has lost his
shield and helmet, and blood drips from his stirrups.
As he draws rein at the door of the castle he drops
dead from his saddle. A brief epilogue points the
moral of the story in quaint fashion. It is to the
effect that knights who will on horseback ride
should not like Oluf stay in elfin groves with elfin
maidens till morning. It is unnecessary to specify
the numbers in detail; as with the exception of the
melodramatic finale, where the music becomes quite
vigorous, it is all of the same graceful, flowing, melodic
character, and needs no key to explain it to the
hearer.</p>
</div>
<div id="c046" title="The Crusaders">
<h4>The Crusaders.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Crusaders&rdquo; is one of the most powerful as
well as beautiful of modern cantatas. It was written
for performance in Copenhagen in 1866, and
ten years later was produced at the Birmingham
Festival, under the composer&rsquo;s direction. It is
divided into three parts, and its story may be told
in a word. Its theme is the same as that which
Wagner has treated in &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; and in &ldquo;T&auml;nnhauser,&rdquo;&mdash;the
conflict of the human soul with the
powers of darkness, sensual beauty and sorcery, and
its final triumph. It is the story of the temptation
of Rinaldo d&rsquo;Este, the bravest of the Crusaders, by
<span class="pb" id="pg_150">[150]</span>
Armida and her sirens, who at last calls upon the
Queen of Spirits to aid them in their hopeless task,
the thwarting of the powers of evil, and the final
triumph before Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The first part opens with a chorus of pilgrims and
women in the band of the Crusaders, expressive of
the weariness and sufferings they have endured in
their long wanderings, the end of which still appears
so far away. As the beautiful music dies away, the
inspiring summons of Peter the Hermit is heard,
leading up to the Crusaders&rsquo; song,&mdash;a vigorous, war-like
melody, full of manly hope and religious fervor.
An evening prayer of pious longing and exalted
devotion closes this part.</p>
<p>The second part is entitled &ldquo;Armida,&rdquo; and introduces
the evil genius of the scene. A strange,
mysterious orchestral prelude indicates the baneful
magic of the sorcerer&rsquo;s wiles. In a remarkably expressive
aria, Armida deplores her weakness in trying
to overcome the power of the cross. As she
sees Rinaldo, who has left his tent to wander for a
time in the night air, she calls to the spirits to obey
her incantation:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t6">&ldquo;Cause a palace grand to rise,</p>
<p class="t6">Let a sea before it glimmer.</p>
<p class="t6">In the walls of richest gold</p>
<p class="t6">Let the purest diamonds shimmer;</p>
<p class="t6">Round the fountains&rsquo; pearly rim,</p>
<p class="t6">Where bright the sunbeams are glancing,</p>
<p class="t6">Plashing low and murmuring sweet,</p>
<p class="t6">Set the merry wavelets dancing.</p>
<p class="t0">In yon hedge of roses where fairies rock in softest dreaming,</p>
<p class="t0">Fays and elfins bid appear, and sirens float in waters dreaming.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_151">[151]</div>
<p class="t6">All around let music ring,</p>
<p class="t6">Fill the air with sweetest singing;</p>
<p class="t6">Lure them on with magic power,</p>
<p class="t6">To our midst all captive bringing.</p>
<p class="t6">Sing remembrance from their hearts,</p>
<p class="t6">Till they bow, my will fulfilling;</p>
<p class="t6">Make them every thought forego,</p>
<p class="t6">Every wish, save mine own, stilling.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After another invocation of the spirits, the sirens
appear, singing a sensuous melody (&ldquo;I dip my
white Breast in the soft-flowing Tide&rdquo;). Then
begins the temptation of the wandering Knight.
He starts in surprise as he hears the voices rising
from the waves, and again they chant their alluring
song. They are followed by Armida, who appeals
to him in a seductive strain (&ldquo;O Rinaldo, come to
never-ending Bliss&rdquo;). The Knight joins with her in
a duet of melodious beauty. He is about to yield to
the temptation, when he hears in the distance the
tones of the Crusaders&rsquo; song. He wavers in his resolution,
Armida and the sirens appeal to him again,
and again he turns as if he would follow them. The
Crusaders&rsquo; song grows louder, and rouses the Knight
from the spell which has been cast about him, and
the scene closes with a beautifully concerted number,
in which Rinaldo, Armida, the chorus of Crusaders
and of sirens contend for the mastery. The
fascination of the Crusaders&rsquo; song is the strongest.
The cross triumphs over the sorceress, and in despair
she sings,&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sink, scenes illusive, deep in dark abyss of doom!</p>
<p class="t0">The light of day is turned to blackest night of gloom.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_152">[152]</div>
<p>The third part, entitled &ldquo;Jerusalem,&rdquo; is religious
in character, and mostly choral. In rapid succession
follow the morning hymn with beautiful
horn accompaniment, the march of the Pilgrims full
of the highest exaltation, the hermit&rsquo;s revelation
of the Holy City to them, their joyous greeting to it,
Rinaldo&rsquo;s resolution to expiate his offence by his
valor, the hermit&rsquo;s last call to strife, their jubilant
reply, and the final victory:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;As our God wills it. Up, arouse thee!</p>
<p class="t0">Up! yon flag with hope endows thee.</p>
<p class="t0">Jerusalem! the goal is there.</p>
<p class="t0">We cry aloud, &lsquo;Hosanna!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<h3>GILCHRIST.</h3>
<p>William W. Gilchrist, the American
composer, was born at Jersey City, N. J.,
in 1846. He began his studies with
H. A. Clarke, professor of music in the
University of Pennsylvania. In 1872 he accepted
the position of organist at the New Jerusalem Church
in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was also appointed teacher
in the Conservatory of Miss Bauer. A year later he
returned to Philadelphia, where he has since resided.
During this time he has done a great work
for music in that city, having been conductor of
several societies. He has been the recipient of
honors on many occasions, having obtained several
prizes from the Philadelphia Art Society and others
for his compositions. In 1880 he contended for
the prize offered by the Cincinnati Musical Festival
Association, but stood third on the list, Dudley
Buck being first and George E. Whiting second. In
1882 he made another trial for the Association&rsquo;s prize,
and was successful; the committee, consisting of Carl
Reinecke of Leipsic, M. Saint-Saens of Paris, and
Theodore Thomas of New York, making him the
award.</p>
</div>
<div id="c048" title="The Forty-sixth Psalm">
<div class="pb" id="pg_154">[154]</div>
<h4>The Forty-sixth Psalm.</h4>
<p>The composition referred to in the sketch of Mr.
Gilchrist&rsquo;s life which secured for him the Cincinnati
prize in 1882 was &ldquo;The Forty-sixth Psalm.&rdquo; The
composer&rsquo;s own analysis of the work, furnished at
the time, is appended:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The composition is a setting of the Forty-sixth
Psalm for soprano solo, chorus, orchestra, and organ,
and has four principal divisions exclusive of an introduction,
each following the other without pause, and
connected by a gradual decrescendo in the orchestra.
The opening of the Psalm seemed to me to indicate a
strong outburst of praise or of thanksgiving for a deliverance
from trials, which the introduction is intended to
convey. But instead of beginning with a strong outburst,
I lead up to it from a very subdued beginning,
working gradually to a climax at the entrance of the
chorus on the words, &lsquo;God is our refuge and our
strength.&rsquo; The opening movement of the chorus becomes
a little subdued very shortly as it takes up the
words, &lsquo;A very present help in trouble,&rsquo; which is followed
again by an <i>allegro con fuoco</i> movement on the
words, &lsquo;Therefore we will not fear though the earth be
removed, though the mountains be carried into the
midst of the sea.&rsquo; This movement leads into still
another, a furioso movement on the words, &lsquo;Though the
waters thereof roar, though the mountains shake with
the swelling thereof.&rsquo; This is followed by an elaborate
coda, in which all the themes of the preceding movement
are worked together, and which brings the chorus
to a close.</p>
<p class="bq">The second division, in E major, is marked by an
<i>andante contemplativo</i> on the words, &lsquo;There is a river
<span class="pb" id="pg_155">[155]</span>
the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God.&rsquo;
This movement is intended to be one of tranquillity,
varied with occasional passionate outbursts on the
words, &lsquo;God is in the midst of her; she shall not be
moved.&rsquo; A peculiar rhythmical effect is sought by
the alternation of 4/4 and 3/4 time, three bars of the first
being answered by two bars of the second. This
movement ends very tranquilly on the words, &lsquo;God
shall help her, and that right early,&rsquo; and is immediately
followed by an <i>allegro molto</i>, in B minor, on the words,
&lsquo;The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved; he
uttered his voice, the earth melted.&rsquo; In the middle of
this chorus the soprano solo enters for the first time on
the words, &lsquo;He maketh wars to cease unto the end of
the earth; He breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear
in sunder.&rsquo; The chorus works up to a strong climax on
the words, &lsquo;He burneth the chariot with fire,&rsquo; which is
suddenly interrupted by a decrescendo on the words,
&lsquo;Be still, and know that I am God.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="bq">This leads to the third division, which is a return of
the second division in E major, and which is played
through almost entirely by the orchestra, the chorus
merely meditating on the words last quoted. This
leads to the final chorus, which is a fugue, in E major,
with <i>alla breve</i> time, on the words, &lsquo;And the Lord of
Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge,&rsquo;
towards the close of which a <i>Gloria Patri</i> is introduced,
being woven in with fragments of the fugue to
a strong climax. The whole composition finishes with
an impetuous accelerando. My central idea was to
make a choral and orchestral work, the solo, while
requiring a good singer, being only secondary. The
Psalm seemed to me particularly adapted for musical
composition, as being capable of a varied, even dramatic
effect.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>GLEASON.</h3>
<p>Frederick Grant Gleason was
born at Middletown, Conn., Dec. 17,
1848. He inherited the love of music
from his parents,&mdash;his father having been
a flutist and his mother an alto singer and pianist.
In his sixteenth year he showed a decided talent
for composition; and two of his works, an oratorio,
&ldquo;The Captivity,&rdquo; and a Christmas oratorio, though
crudely written, gave such promise that he was placed
under the tuition of Dudley Buck, with whom he
studied the piano and composition. He made such
rapid progress that his parents were induced to send
him to Germany, where he at once entered the
Leipsic Conservatory. Moscheles taught him the
piano, and Richter harmony, and he also took private
lessons from Plaidy and Lobe. In 1870 he
went to Berlin, where he continued his piano studies
with Raif, a pupil of Tausig, and his tuition in harmony
with Weitzmann. After a visit home he went
to England and resumed lessons on the piano with
Berringer, another pupil of Tausig, and also studied
English music. He subsequently made a second
<span class="pb" id="pg_157">[157]</span>
visit to Berlin, and improved his time by studying
theory with Weitzmann, the piano with Loeschorn,
and the organ with Haupt. During this visit he
also issued a valuable work entitled &ldquo;Gleason&rsquo;s
Motet Collection.&rdquo; After the completion of his
studies he returned home and accepted the position
of organist at one of the Hartford churches. In
1876 he removed to Chicago and engaged as teacher
in the Hershey School of Musical Art. At present
he is still occupied in teaching and also fills the
position of musical critic for the &ldquo;Tribune&rdquo; of that
city. During these years his pen has been very
busy, as the list of his compositions shows. Among
his principal works are two operas, still in manuscript,&mdash;&ldquo;Otho
Visconti&rdquo; and &ldquo;Montezuma;&rdquo; the
cantatas &ldquo;God our Deliverer,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Culprit Fay,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Praise of Harmony;&rdquo; and several trios, sonatas,
and other works for the chamber, as well as many
songs. The selections from his operas which have
been played by the Thomas orchestra show that
they are compositions of unusual excellence and
scholarship.</p>
</div>
<div id="c050" title="The Culprit Fay">
<h4>The Culprit Fay.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Culprit Fay,&rdquo; a musical setting of Joseph
Rodman Drake&rsquo;s well-known fairy poem, was written
in 1879. It is divided into three parts,&mdash;the first
containing five, the second five, and the third eight
numbers; the solos being divided among soprano,
alto, tenor, and barytone, the last named taking the
<span class="pb" id="pg_158">[158]</span>
part of the Fairy King. The exquisitely graceful
fairy story told in the poem is too well known to
need description. It is admirably adapted to music
by its rhythmic fluency as well as by the delicacy of
its poetical sentiment; and while it does not call for
earnestness or strength in any of its movements,
there is ample opportunity for melodious and attractive
pictures in tone of the dainty descriptions
of the poet. The composer has improved these opportunities
with much skill, and, notwithstanding the
intrinsic lightness of the score, has secured musical
unity and poetical coherence by the artistic use of
the <i>leit-motif</i>. Nine of these motives are employed,
characterizing the summer night, the elfin mystery,
the life of the fairies, the fay&rsquo;s love for the mortal
maid, the penalty for this violation of fairy law, night
on the river, the spells of the water imps, the penalties
imposed upon the culprit, and the Sylphide
Queen&rsquo;s passion for the Fay. The skilfulness with
which these motives are adapted to characters and
situations, and interwoven with the general movement
in their proper recurrence, shows that the composer
has not studied Wagner, the master of the
<i>leit-motif</i>, in vain.</p>
<p>After a short introduction for the horns and
strings, the cantata opens with a full chorus of graceful,
flowing character (&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the Middle Watch of
a Summer&rsquo;s Night&rdquo;) describing the moonlight scene
about &ldquo;Old Cro&rsquo; Nest.&rdquo; It is followed by the
mystery motive announcing a weird alto solo, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
the Hour of Fairy Ban and Spell.&rdquo; It is the summons
<span class="pb" id="pg_159">[159]</span>
of the sentry elf, ringing the hour of twelve,
indicated in the score by the triangle, and calling
the fairies to confront the culprit. A stirring and
blithe instrumental introduction, followed by a short
chorus (&ldquo;They come from Beds of Lichen green&rdquo;),
describes the gathering of the fays, retarded at the
close, and growing sombre as it is announced that
&ldquo;an ouphe has broken his vestal vow.&rdquo; A tenor
solo (&ldquo;He has loved an earthly Maid&rdquo;) tells the sad
story of the guilty one who &ldquo;has lain upon her lip
of dew&rdquo; and &ldquo;nestled on her snowy breast.&rdquo; They
gather about to hear his doom, and do not have to
wait long; for the tenor song leads without break to
a barytone solo, in recitative form, by the Fairy King
(&ldquo;Fairy, Fairy, list and mark&rdquo;), pronouncing the
penalties he must pay for his transgression,&mdash;the
catching of a drop from the sturgeon&rsquo;s silver bow
to wash away the stain on his wings, and the relighting
of his flamewood lamp by the last faint spark in
the train of a shooting star.</p>
<p>A graceful chorus (&ldquo;Soft and pale is the moony
Beam&rdquo;) opens the second part, picturing the scene
upon the strand bordering the elfin land; and the
leaps of the sturgeon, followed by a tenor solo
and recitative describing the sorrow of the lonely
sprite and his desperate effort to push his mussel-shell
boat down to the verge of the haunted land.
The alto, which does all the mystery work, goes on
with the description of the vain attempt of the river
imps to wreck his frail craft, and his discovery and
pursuit of the sturgeon; then there is a pause. The
<span class="pb" id="pg_160">[160]</span>
full chorus, in a quick movement, pictures the pretty
scene of the sturgeon&rsquo;s leap, the arch of silver sheen,
and the puny goblin waiting to catch the drop. The
tenor recitative announces his success, and a full
jubilant chorus of the sprites (&ldquo;Joy to thee, Fay!
thy Task is done&rdquo;) bids him hasten back to the
elfin shore.</p>
<p>The third part opens with a full chorus, very animated
in its progression (&ldquo;Up to the Cope, careering
swift&rdquo;), describing the ride of the Fay past the
sphered moon and up to the bank of the Milky Way,
where he checks his courser to wait for the shooting
star. In the next number, a short recitative, the
alto has a more grateful task; this time it is the
graceful sylphs of heaven who appear, weaving their
dance about the Fay, and leading him on to the
palace of the Sylphide Queen. It is followed by
two charming soprano solos,&mdash;the one descriptive
of her beauty as she listens to the story of the Fay,
and the other (&ldquo;O Sweet Spirit of Earth&rdquo;) of her
sudden passion and the tempting inducements by
which she seeks to make him forget the joys of fairy-land.
Once more the tenor, who plays the part of
narrator, enters, and in solo and recitative assures
us how like a brave homunculus the Fay resisted her
blandishments. A very vigorous and descriptive
chorus, as fast as can be sung, pictures the Fay careering
along on the wings of the blast up to the
northern plain, where at length a star &ldquo;bursts in
flash and flame.&rdquo; The tenor announces his second
success, and the final chorus (&ldquo;Ouphe and Goblin!
<span class="pb" id="pg_161">[161]</span>
Imp and Sprite&rdquo;) sings his welcome back in an animated
manner, beginning with a moderate movement
which constantly accelerates and works up to
a fine climax; after which&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The hill-tops glow in morning&rsquo;s spring,</p>
<p class="t0">The skylark shakes his dappled wing,</p>
<p class="t0">The day glimpse glimmers on the lawn,</p>
<p class="t0">The cock has crowed and the fays are gone.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c051" title="The Praise Song To Harmony">
<h4>The Praise Song to Harmony.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Praise Song to Harmony,&rdquo; written in 1886,
is a musical setting of a poem of the same name
by David Ebeling, a German poet who lived in the
latter part of the eighteenth century. The composition
is in a strict sense a symphonic cantata, somewhat
in the manner of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hymn of
Praise,&rdquo; being prefaced with a symphonic allegro in
the classical form which is written in a very scholarly
manner and displays great skill in thematic
treatment.</p>
<p>The cantata proper opens with a short introduction,
consisting of massive chord foundations
for the full orchestra, connected by a figure for the
strings, ushering in a chorus for male voices (&ldquo;Hail
thee, O Harmony, offspring of Heaven&rdquo;). The
words contain a description of the creation of
worlds and of music, as the song of stars unites
with the angel chorus in praise of the Almighty.
At the close of this number begins a choral theme
for trumpets, horns, and trombones, followed by
<span class="pb" id="pg_162">[162]</span>
strings and woodwinds, and introducing a soprano
recitative (&ldquo;With Grace, thy Gaze, O Harmony&rdquo;)
descriptive of the blessing brought into the world
by music, followed by a picture of the misery of
the race without its consolation. At the close the
brasses give out a solemn march-like theme. A
short chorus (&ldquo;Joy to us! Again descending,
thou Heavenly One&rdquo;) describes the might of song.
A brief orchestral interlude follows, preparing the
entrance of a barytone solo with chorus (&ldquo;Blessed
Comforter in Grief&rdquo;). The work closes with a
partial repetition of the opening chorus, with a more
elaborate and brilliant figural accompaniment, in
the course of which the march-like subject is heard
again in the brasses. At the end the strings maintain
a tremolo while the rest of the orchestra presents
a passage with varied harmonies. The opening
theme of the cantata, though not a repetition, bears
a strong analogy to the introduction of the symphony
movement.</p>

<h3>HANDEL.</h3>
<p>George Frederick Handel was
born at Halle, in Lower Saxony, Feb. 23,
1685, and like many another composer
revealed his musical promise at a very
early age, only to encounter parental opposition.
His father intended him to be a lawyer; but Nature
had her way, and in spite of domestic antagonism
triumphed. The Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels recognized
his ability and overcame the father&rsquo;s determination.
Handel began his studies with Zachau,
organist of the Halle cathedral. After the death
of his father, in 1697, he went to Hamburg, and
for a time played in the orchestra of the German
opera. It was during his residence in that city that
he wrote his first opera, &ldquo;Almira&rdquo; (1705). In
the following year he went to Italy, where he remained
several months under the patronage of the
Grand Duke of Florence. During the next two
years he visited Venice, Rome, and Naples, and
wrote several operas and minor oratorios. In 1709
he returned to Germany, and the Elector of Hanover,
subsequently George I. of England, offered
<span class="pb" id="pg_164">[164]</span>
him the position of capellmeister, which he accepted
upon the condition that he might visit England,
having received many invitations from that
country. The next year he arrived in London and
brought out his opera of &ldquo;Rinaldo,&rdquo; which proved
a great success. At the end of six months he was
obliged to return to his position in Hanover; but
the English success made him impatient of the
dulness of the court. In 1712 he was in London
again, little dreaming that the Elector would soon
follow him as king. Incensed with him for leaving
Hanover, the King at first refused to receive him;
but some music which Handel composed for an
aquatic f&ecirc;te in his honor brought about the royal
reconciliation. In 1718 he accepted the position
of chapel-master to the Duke of Chandos, for
whom he wrote the famous Chandos Te Deum and
Anthems, the serenata &ldquo;Acis and Galatea,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Esther,&rdquo; his first English oratorio. In 1720 he was
engaged as director of Italian opera by the society
of noblemen known as the Royal Academy of Music,
and from that time until 1740 his career was entirely
of an operatic character. Opera after opera
came from his pen. Some were successful, others
failed. At first composer, then director, he finally
became <i>impresario</i>, only to find himself confronted
with bitter rivalry, especially at the hands of Bononcini
and Porpora. Cabals were instituted against
him. Unable to contend with them alone, he
formed a partnership with Heidegger, proprietor of
the King&rsquo;s Theatre, in 1729. It was broken in 1734,
<span class="pb" id="pg_165">[165]</span>
and he took the management of Covent Garden.
The Italian conspiracies against him broke out
afresh. He failed in his undertaking and became
a bankrupt. Slanders of all sorts were circulated,
and his works were no longer well received. In
the midst of his adversity sickness overtook him,
ending with a partial stroke of paralysis. When
sufficiently recovered he went to the Continent,
where he remained for a few months. On his return
to London he brought out some new works,
but they were not favorably received. A few friends
who had remained faithful to him persuaded him to
give a benefit concert, which was a great success.
It inspired him with fresh courage; but he did not
again return to the operatic world. Thenceforward
he devoted himself to oratorio, in which he made
his name famous for all time. He himself said:
&ldquo;Sacred music is best suited to a man descending
in the vale of years.&rdquo; &ldquo;Saul&rdquo; and the colossal
&ldquo;Israel in Egypt,&rdquo; written in 1740, head the list of
his wonderful oratorios. In 1741 he was invited to
visit Ireland. He went there in November, and
many of his works were produced during the winter
and received with great enthusiasm. In April, 1742,
his immortal &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; was brought out at Dublin.
It was followed by &ldquo;Samson,&rdquo; &ldquo;Joseph,&rdquo; &ldquo;Semele,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Belshazzar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hercules,&rdquo; which were also
successful; but even in the midst of his oratorio
work his rivals did not cease their conspiracies
against him, and in 1744 he was once more a
bankrupt. For over a year his pen was idle. In
<span class="pb" id="pg_166">[166]</span>
1746 the &ldquo;Occasional Oratorio&rdquo; and &ldquo;Judas Maccab&aelig;us&rdquo;
appeared, and these were speedily followed
by &ldquo;Joshua,&rdquo; &ldquo;Solomon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Susanna,&rdquo; &ldquo;Theodora,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Jephthah.&rdquo; It was during the composition
of the last-named work that he was attacked
with the illness which finally proved fatal. He died
April 14, 1759, and was buried in Westminster
Abbey. During the last few days of his life he was
heard to express the wish that &ldquo;he might breathe
his last on Good Friday, in hopes of meeting his
good God, his sweet Lord and Saviour, on the day
of His resurrection.&rdquo; The wish was granted him;
for it was on Good Friday that he passed away,
leaving behind him a name and fame that will be
cherished so long as music retains its power over the
human heart.</p>
</div>
<div id="c053" title="Acis and Galatea">
<h4>Acis and Galatea.</h4>
<p>The first idea of Handel&rsquo;s famous pastoral, &ldquo;Acis
and Galatea,&rdquo; is to be found in a serenata, &ldquo;Aci,
Galatea, e Polifemo,&rdquo; which he produced at Naples
in July, 1708. The plan of the work resembles
that of the later pastoral, though its musical setting
is entirely different.<sup><a id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></sup>
Little was known of it however
until nearly a quarter of a century afterwards,
<span class="pb" id="pg_167">[167]</span>
when the composer revived portions of it in one
of his London concerts, as will shortly be seen.</p>
<p>In 1718 Handel entered the service of James,
Duke of Chandos, as chapel-master, succeeding Dr.
Pepusch. His patron had accumulated an immense
fortune and spent it in a princely manner. He
had built a marble palace, at an enormous expense,
at Cannons in Middlesex, where he lived in almost
regal state. It was the chapel attached to this mansion
over which Handel was called to preside, and
there were ready for his use a large choir, a band of
instrumental performers, and a fine organ. The
anthems and services of his predecessor were laid
aside, and that year Handel&rsquo;s busy pen supplied two
new settings of the Te Deum and the twelve Chandos
Anthems, which are really cantatas in form.
His first English opera, &ldquo;Esther,&rdquo; was also composed
at Cannons, and was followed by the beautiful
pastoral which forms the subject of this sketch.
&ldquo;Esther&rdquo; was first performed Aug. 20, 1720, and
it is generally agreed that &ldquo;Acis and Galatea&rdquo; followed
it in the same year, though Schoelcher in his
biography assigns 1721 as the date. Nine characters
are contained in the original manuscript,&mdash;Galatea,
Clori, and Eurilla, sopranos; Acis, Filli,
Dorinda, and Damon, altos; Silvio, tenor; and
Polifemo, bass.</p>
<p>After this private performance the pastoral was
not again heard from until 1731-32, when it was
given under peculiar circumstances. On the 13th
of March, 1731, it was performed for the benefit of
<span class="pb" id="pg_168">[168]</span>
one Rochetti, who took the r&ocirc;le of Acis; but with
this representation Handel had nothing to do. The
act of piracy was repeated in the following year,
when Mr. Arne, father of Dr. Arne the composer,
and the lessee of the Little Theatre in the Haymarket,
announced its performance as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;At the new theatre in the Haymarket, on Thursday
next, 11th May, will be performed in English a
pastoral opera called &lsquo;Acis and Galatea,&rsquo; with all the
choruses, scenes, machines, and other decorations,
etc. (as before), being the first time it was ever performed
in a theatrical way. The part of Acis by Mr.
Mourtier, being the first time of his appearance in
character on any stage; Galatea, Miss Arne.<sup><a id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a></sup>
Pit and boxes, 5<i>s.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Handel had taken no notice of the 1731 performance;
but this representation, given at a theatre
directly opposite the one of which he was manager,
roused his resentment, though piracy of this kind
was very common in those days. He determined to
outdo the manager &ldquo;over the way.&rdquo; On the 5th of
June he announced in the &ldquo;Daily Journal&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;In the King&rsquo;s Theatre in the Haymarket, the
present Saturday, being the 10th of June, will be performed
a serenata called &lsquo;Acis and Galatea,&rsquo; formerly
composed by Mr. Handel, and now revised by him,
with several additions, and to be performed by a great
<span class="pb" id="pg_169">[169]</span>
number of the best voices and instruments. There
will be no action on the stage,<sup><a id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a></sup>
but the scene will
represent in a picturesque manner a rural prospect,
with rocks, groves, fountains, and grottos, among
which will be disposed a chorus of nymphs and shepherds;
the habits, and every other decoration, suited
to the subject. Also on the 13th, 17th, 20th. The
libretto printed for J. Watts, in three acts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rival establishment had produced the work
as it was originally given at Cannons; but as intimated
in his advertisement, Handel made additions,
interpolating a number of airs and choruses from
the serenata which he had composed at Naples,
thus requiring the work to be sung both in Italian
and English,&mdash;a polyglot practice from which our
own times are not exempt. The part of Acis was
sung by Senesino, a male soprano; Galatea by
Signora Strada; and Polyphemus by Montagnana.
The other parts&mdash;Clori and Eurilla sopranos, Filli
and Dorinda contraltos, and Silvio tenor&mdash;were
also represented. It was performed eight times in
<span class="pb" id="pg_170">[170]</span>
1732, and was brought out in the same form at
Oxford in 1733; but in 1739 Handel restored it to
its original shape as it had been given at Cannons.
It is now generally performed in two parts with the
three characters Galatea, Acis, and Polyphemus,
and choruses of nymphs and shepherds.</p>
<p>The pretty pastoral will always possess more than
ordinary interest, as four celebrated poets are represented
in the construction of the poem. Gay
wrote the most of it. It also contains a strophe
by Hughes, a verse by Pope,<sup><a id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></sup>
and an extract from Dryden&rsquo;s translation of the Galatea myth in the
Metamorphoses of Ovid.<sup><a id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></sup>
The story is based on the seventh fable in the thirteenth book
of the Metamorphoses,&mdash;the sad story which Galatea, daughter
of Nereus, tells to Scylla. The nymph was passionately
in love with the shepherd Acis, son of Faunus
and of the nymph Sym&oelig;this, and pursued him incessantly.
She too was pursued by Polyphemus,
the one-eyed Cyclops of &AElig;tna, contemner of the
gods. One day, reclining upon the breast of Acis,
concealed behind a rock, she hears the giant pouring
out to the woods and mountains his story of
love and despair: &ldquo;I, who despise Jove and the
heavens and the piercing lightnings, dread thee,
daughter of Nereus; than the lightnings is thy wrath
<span class="pb" id="pg_171">[171]</span>
more dreadful to me. But I should be more patient
under these slights if thou didst avoid all men.
For why, rejecting the Cyclop, dost thou love
Acis? And why prefer Acis to my embraces?&rdquo;
As he utters these last complaints, he espies the
lovers. Then, raging and roaring so that the mountains
shook and the sea trembled, he hurled a huge
rock at Acis and crushed him. The shepherd&rsquo;s
blood gushing forth from beneath the rock was
changed into a river; and Galatea, who had fled to
the sea, was consoled.</p>
<p>The overture to the work, consisting of one movement,
is thoroughly pastoral in its style and marked
by all that grace and delicacy which characterize
the composer&rsquo;s treatment of movements of this
kind. It introduces a chorus (&ldquo;O the Pleasures
of the Plains!&rdquo;) in which the easy, careless life of
the shepherds and their swains is pictured. Galatea
enters seeking her lover, and after the recitative,
&ldquo;Ye verdant Plains and woody Mountains,&rdquo; relieves
her heart with an outburst of melodious
beauty:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hush, ye pretty warbling choir!</p>
<p class="t3">Your thrilling strains</p>
<p class="t3">Awake my pains</p>
<p class="t3">And kindle fierce desire.</p>
<p class="t0">Cease your song and take your flight;</p>
<p class="t0">Bring back my Acis to my sight.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Acis answers her, after a short recitative, with
another aria equally graceful (&ldquo;Love in her Eyes
sits playing and sheds delicious Death&rdquo;). The
<span class="pb" id="pg_172">[172]</span>
melodious and sensuous dialogue is continued by
Galatea, who once more sings:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;As when the dove</p>
<p class="t0">Laments her love</p>
<p class="t0">All on the naked spray;</p>
<p class="t0">When he returns</p>
<p class="t0">No more she mourns,</p>
<p class="t0">But loves the live-long day.</p>
<p class="t0">Billing, cooing,</p>
<p class="t0">Panting, wooing,</p>
<p class="t0">Melting murmurs fill the grove,</p>
<p class="t0">Melting murmurs, lasting love.&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then in a duet, sparkling with the happiness of
the lovers (&ldquo;Happy We&rdquo;), closing with chorus to
the same words, this pretty picture of ancient pastoral
life among the nymphs and shepherds comes
to an end.</p>
<p>In the second part there is another tone both to
scene and music. The opening chorus of alarm
(&ldquo;Wretched Lovers&rdquo;) portends the coming of the
love-sick Cyclops; the mountains bow, the forests
shake, the waves run frightened to the shore as he
approaches roaring and calling for &ldquo;a hundred
reeds of decent growth,&rdquo; that on &ldquo;such pipe&rdquo; his
capacious mouth may play the praises of Galatea.
The recitative, &ldquo;I melt, I rage, I burn,&rdquo; is very
characteristic, and leads to the giant&rsquo;s love-song, an
unctuous, catching melody almost too full of humor
and grace for the fierce brute of &AElig;tna:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O ruddier than the cherry!</p>
<p class="t0">O sweeter than the berry!</p>
<p class="t2">O nymph more bright</p>
<p class="t2">Than moonshine night,</p>
<p class="t0">Like kidlings, blithe and merry.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_173">[173]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ripe as the melting cluster,</p>
<p class="t0">No lily has such lustre.</p>
<p class="t2">Yet hard to tame</p>
<p class="t2">As raging flame,</p>
<p class="t0">And fierce as storms that bluster.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In marked contrast with this declaration follows
the plaintive tender song of Acis (&ldquo;Love sounds
the Alarm&rdquo;). Galatea appeals to him to trust the
gods, and then the three join in a trio (&ldquo;The Flocks
shall leave the Mountain&rdquo;). Enraged at his discomfiture,
the giant puts forth his power. He is no
longer the lover piping to Galatea and dissembling
his real nature, but a destructive raging force; and
the fragment of mountain which he tears away
buries poor Acis as effectually as &AElig;tna sometimes
does the plains beneath. The catastrophe accomplished,
the work closes with the sad lament of
Galatea for her lover (&ldquo;Must I my Acis still bemoan?&rdquo;)
and the choral consolations of the shepherds
and their swains:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Galatea, dry thy tears,</p>
<p class="t0">Acis now a god appears;</p>
<p class="t0">See how he rears him from his bed!</p>
<p class="t0">See the wreath that binds his head!</p>
<p class="t0">Hail! thou gentle murmuring stream;</p>
<p class="t0">Shepherds&rsquo; pleasure, Muses&rsquo; theme;</p>
<p class="t0">Through the plains still joy to rove,</p>
<p class="t0">Murmuring still thy gentle love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fnblock">
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_21" href="#fr_21">[21]</a></sup> The superior attractions of the English serenata will probably
prevent the earlier work from ever becoming a popular favorite;
more especially since the r&ocirc;le of Polifemo needs a bass singer with
a voice of the extraordinary compass of two octaves and a half.&mdash;<i>Rockstro&rsquo;s
Life of Handel</i>.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_22" href="#fr_22">[22]</a></sup> Miss Arne, afterwards Mrs. Cibber, enjoyed, under the latter

</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_23" href="#fr_23">[23]</a></sup> This undoubtedly is the manner in which this charming little
piece ought to be performed. It is a dramatic poem, but not an
acting play, and the incidents are such as cannot be represented on
the stage. A few years ago another attempt was made to perform
it as an opera, but without success. Polyphemus is entirely an
ideal character, and any attempt to personate him must be ridiculous;
and the concluding scene, in which the giant throws a huge
rock at the head of his rival, produced shouts of merriment. &ldquo;Acis
and Galatea&rdquo; is performed in an orchestra in the manner in which
oratorios are performed; but its effect would certainly be heightened
by the picturesque scenery and decorations employed by Handel
himself.&mdash;<i>Hogarth&rsquo;s Musical Drama</i>.

<h4>Alexander&rsquo;s Feast.</h4>
<p>Handel composed the music for Dryden&rsquo;s immortal
ode in 1736. In the original score the close
of the first part is dated January 5, and the end of
<span class="pb" id="pg_174">[174]</span>
the work January 17, showing rapid composition.
Three years before this time he had had a violent
quarrel with Senesino, his principal singer at the
opera-house in the Haymarket, which led to his
abandonment of the theatre and its occupancy by
his rival, Porpora. After an unsuccessful attempt
to compete with the latter, which nearly bankrupted
him in health and purse, he decided to quit opera
altogether. He sought relief for his physical ailments
at Aix-la-Chapelle, and upon his return to
London in October, 1735, publicly announced that
&ldquo;Mr. Handel will perform Oratorios and have
Concerts of Musick this Winter at Covent Garden
Theatre.&rdquo; One of the first works for these concerts
was &ldquo;Alexander&rsquo;s Feast,&rdquo; completed, as stated
above, Jan. 17, 1736. The poem was prepared by
Newburgh Hamilton, who says in his preface:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I determined not to take any unwarrantable liberty
with the poem, which has long done honor to the
nation, and which no man can add to or abridge in
anything material without injuring it. I therefore
confined myself to a plain division of it into airs, recitatives
or choruses, looking upon the words in general
so sacred as scarcely to violate one in the order
of its first place. How I have succeeded the world is
to judge, and whether I have preserved that beautiful
description of the passions, so exquisitely drawn, at
the same time I strove to reduce them to the present
taste in sounds. I confess my principal view was, not
to lose this favorable opportunity of its being set to
music by that great master who has with pleasure
undertaken the task, and who only is capable of doing
<span class="pb" id="pg_175">[175]</span>
it justice; whose compositions have long shown that
they can conquer even the most obstinate partiality,
and inspire life into the most senseless words. If this
entertainment can in the least degree give satisfaction
to the real judges of poetry or music, I shall think
myself happy in having promoted it; being persuaded
that it is next to an improbability to offer
the world anything in those arts more perfect than
the united labors and utmost efforts of a Dryden and
a Handel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the preface Hamilton appended a
poem &ldquo;To Mr. Handel on his setting to Musick
Mr. Dryden&rsquo;s Feast of Alexander,&rdquo; in which he
enthusiastically sings:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Two glowing sparks of that celestial flame</p>
<p class="t0">Which warms by mystick art this earthly frame,</p>
<p class="t0">United in one blaze of genial heat,</p>
<p class="t0">Produced this piece in sense and sounds complete.</p>
<p class="t0">The Sister Arts, as breathing from one soul,</p>
<p class="t0">With equal spirit animate the whole.</p>
<p class="t0">Had Dryden lived the welcome day to bless,</p>
<p class="t0">Which clothed his numbers in so fit a dress,</p>
<p class="t0">When his majestick poetry was crowned</p>
<p class="t0">With all your bright magnificence of sound,</p>
<p class="t0">How would his wonder and his transport rise,</p>
<p class="t0">Whilst famed Timotheus yields to you the prize!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The work was first performed at Covent Garden
Theatre, February 19, about a month after it was written;
the principal singers being Signora Strada, Miss Young,<sup><a id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></sup>
John Beard, and Mr. Erard. It met with
<span class="pb" id="pg_176">[176]</span>
remarkable success. The London &ldquo;Daily Post,&rdquo;
on the morning after its production, said:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Never was upon the like Occasion so numerous
and splendid an Audience at any Theatre in London,
there being at least 1,300 Persons present; and it is
judged that the Receipt of the House could not amount
to less than &pound;450.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was repeated four times, and then withdrawn
to make room for &ldquo;Acis and Galatea&rdquo; and the
oratorio of &ldquo;Esther.&rdquo; In March, 1737, it was revived,
with two additional choruses made by Hamilton
for the work; and upon the same occasion an
Italian cantata in praise of Saint Cecilia was sung.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to inform the reader of the nature
of a poem familiar the world over. The overture is
written for strings and two oboes. Throughout the
work the orchestration is thin, bassoons and horns
being the only instruments added to those named
above; but in 1790 Mozart amplified the accompaniments,&mdash;an
improvement which he also made
for the score of &ldquo;Acis and Galatea.&rdquo; The great
solos of the composition are the furious aria, &ldquo;&lsquo;Revenge,
Revenge!&rsquo; Timotheus cries,&rdquo; and the descriptive
recitative, &ldquo;Give the Vengeance due to
the valiant Crew,&rdquo; in which Handel employs his
imitative powers with consummate effect. Clouet,
in his &ldquo;Chants Classiques,&rdquo; says of the passage
&ldquo;And the king seized a flambeau with zeal to destroy:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;He paints Alexander issuing forth in the midst of
an orgie, arming himself with a torch, and followed by
<span class="pb" id="pg_177">[177]</span>
his generals, running to set fire to Persepolis. While
the accompaniment sparkles with the confused and unequal
glare of the torches, the song expresses truthfully
the precipitation and the tumult of the crowd, the
rolling of the flames, and the living splendor of a
conflagration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The choruses of the work are equally strong, and
some of them are among the best Handel ever
wrote, particularly, &ldquo;He sang Darius great and
good,&rdquo; &ldquo;Break his Bands of Sleep asunder,&rdquo; &ldquo;Let
old Timotheus yield the Prize,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The many
rend the Skies with loud Applause.&rdquo; They are
as genuine inspirations as the best choruses of the
&ldquo;Messiah&rdquo; or of &ldquo;Israel in Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1739 Handel also set to music Dryden&rsquo;s
shorter &ldquo;Ode for St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Day,&rdquo; beginning,</p>

in 1687 by Giovanni Baptista Draghi, an Italian,
who was music-master to Queen Anne and Queen
Mary, and at that time was organist to Catharine of
Braganza, widow of Charles II. Handel&rsquo;s setting
was first performed on the anniversary of the saint&rsquo;s
festival, Nov. 22, 1739. The programme announced:</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields. At the Theatre Royal in
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields, Thursday next, November 22

instruments, which will be preceded by Alexander&rsquo;s

<h4>L&rsquo;Allegro.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;L&rsquo;Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato,&rdquo; the
first two movements of which contain a musical setting
of Milton&rsquo;s well-known poem, was written in
the seventeen days from Jan. 19 to Feb. 6, 1740,
and was first performed on the 27th of the latter
month at the Royal Theatre, Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields,
London. Upon this occasion the first and second
parts were preceded, according to the handbook,
by &ldquo;a new concerto for several instruments,&rdquo; and
the third by &ldquo;a new concerto on the organ,&rdquo; which
was played by the composer himself. It was performed
again Jan. 31, 1741, with the addition of
ten new numbers to the music, which in the original
manuscript appear at the end, marked by Handel,
&ldquo;l&rsquo;Additione.&rdquo; At a still later period Handel
omitted the third part (&ldquo;Moderato&rdquo;) entirely, and
substituted for it Dryden&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ode on St. Cecilia&rsquo;s
Day,&rdquo; which he composed in 1739.</p>
<p>The text of the first two parts is by Milton,
Allegro, as is well known, chanting the praises of pleasure,
Penseroso those of melancholy; Allegro represented
by tenor and Penseroso by soprano, and
each supported by a chorus which joins in the
discussion of the two moods. There is a radical
difference between the poem as Milton wrote it
and as it appears set to Handel&rsquo;s music. Milton
<span class="pb" id="pg_179">[179]</span>
presented two distinct poems, though allied by
antithesis, and Penseroso does not speak until Allegro
has finished. In the poem as adapted for
music they alternate in sixteen strophes and antistrophes.
The adaptation of these two parts was
made by Charles Jennens, who was a frequent
collaborator with Handel.<sup><a id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a></sup>
He also suggested the
addition of a third part, the Moderato, and wrote the
words, in which he counsels both Allegro and Penseroso
to take the middle course of moderation as
the safest. The wisdom of the poet in suggesting
the <i>via media</i> is more to be commended than his
boldness in supplementing Milton&rsquo;s stately verse with
commonplaces, however wise they may have been.
Chrysander, the German biographer of Handel presents
a philosophical view of the case. He says:</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;In the two pictures a deeply thoughtful mind has
fixed for itself two far-reaching goals. With these
the poem has reached its perfect end, and in the sense
of its inventor there is nothing further to be added.
The only possible, the only natural outlet was that
into a <i>life of action</i>, according to the direction which
the spirit now should take; already it was the first
step into this new domain which called forth the divided
feeling. The two moods do not run together
into any third mood as their point of union, but into
active real life, as different characters, forever separate.
Therefore &lsquo;Moderation&rsquo; could not bring about the
<span class="pb" id="pg_180">[180]</span>
reconciliation; only life could do it; not contemplation,
but deeds. Gladness and Melancholy are symptoms
of a vigorous soul; moderation would be mediocrity.
And herein lies the unpoetic nature of the addition by
Jennens; read according to Milton, the concluding
moral of a rich English land-owner whose inherited
abundance points to nothing but a golden mean, and
whose only real problem is to keep the balance in the
lazy course of an inactive life, makes a disheartening
impression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work as a whole is one of Handel&rsquo;s finest
inspirations. The Allegro is bright and spirited
throughout; the Penseroso grave and tender; and
the Moderato quiet and respectable, as might be
expected of a person who never experiences the
enthusiasms of joy or the comforts of melancholy.
The most of the composition is assigned to solo
voices which carry on the discussion, though in the
Moderato it is mainly the chorus which urges the
sedate compromise between the two.</p>
<p>The work opens without overture, its place having
originally been supplied by an orchestral concerto.
In vigorous and very dramatic recitative
Allegro bids &ldquo;loathed Melancholy&rdquo; hence, followed
by Penseroso, who in a few bars of recitative far
less vigorously consigns &ldquo;vain, deluding joys&rdquo; to
&ldquo;some idle brain;&rdquo; Allegro replies with the first aria
(&ldquo;Come, come, thou Goddess fair&rdquo;), a beautifully
free and flowing melody, responded to by Penseroso,
who in an aria of stately rhythm appeals to his
goddess, &ldquo;Divinest Melancholy.&rdquo; Now Allegro
summons his retinue of mirth:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_181">[181]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee</p>
<p class="t0">Jest and youthful jollity,</p>
<p class="t0">Quips and cranks and wanton wiles,</p>
<p class="t0">Nods and becks and wreath&egrave;d smiles,</p>
<p class="t0">Such as hang on Hebe&rsquo;s cheek,</p>
<p class="t0">And love to live in dimple sleek,</p>
<p class="t0">Sport, that wrinkled care derides,</p>
<p class="t0">And Laughter, holding both his sides;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and the chorus takes up the jovial refrain in the
same temper. The aria itself is well known as the
laughing song. Indeed, both aria and chorus are
full of unrestrained mirth, and go laughingly along
in genuine musical giggles.<sup><a id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></sup>
The effect is still further
enhanced by the next aria for Allegro (&ldquo;Come
and trip it as you go&rdquo;), a graceful minuet, which
is also taken by the chorus. After a recitative
<span class="pb" id="pg_182">[182]</span>
by Penseroso (&ldquo;Come, pensive Nun&rdquo;), and the
aria, &ldquo;Come, but keep thy wonted State&rdquo; the
first Penseroso chorus occurs (&ldquo;Join with thee
calm Peace and Quiet&rdquo;), a short but beautiful passage
of tranquil harmony. Once more in recitative
Allegro bids &ldquo;loathed Melancholy&rdquo; hence, and then
in the aria, &ldquo;Mirth, admit me of thy Crew,&rdquo; leading
into a chorus, sings of the lark, &ldquo;startling dull
Night&rdquo; and bidding good-morrow at his window,&mdash;a
brilliant number accompanied with an imitation
of the lark&rsquo;s song. Penseroso replies with an
equally brilliant song (&ldquo;Sweet Bird, that shuns&rsquo;t the
Noise of Folly&rdquo;), in which the nightingale plays the
part of accompaniment. Another aria by Allegro
(&ldquo;Mirth, admit me of thy Crew&rdquo;) gives an opportunity
for a blithe and jocund hunting-song for the
bass, followed by one of the most beautiful numbers
in the work (&ldquo;Oft on a Plat of rising Ground&rdquo;)
sung by Penseroso, in which the ringing of the far-off
curfew, &ldquo;swinging slow, with sullen roar,&rdquo; is
introduced with telling effect. This is followed by
a quiet meditative aria (&ldquo;Far from all Resorts of
Mirth&rdquo;), when once again Allegro takes up the
strain in the two arias, &ldquo;Let me wander not unseen,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Straight mine Eye hath caught new Pleasures.&rdquo;
The first part closes with the Allegro aria and
chorus (&ldquo;Or let the merry Bells ring round&rdquo;), full
of the very spirit of joy and youth; and ending
with an exquisite harmonic effect as the gay crowd
creep to bed, &ldquo;by whispering winds soon lulled
to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_183">[183]</div>
<p>The second part begins with a stately recitative
and aria by Penseroso (&ldquo;Sometimes let gorgeous
Tragedy&rdquo;), followed by one of the most characteristic
arias in the work (&ldquo;But O, sad Virgin, that thy
Power might raise!&rdquo;) in which the passage,</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing</p>
<p class="t0">Such notes as warbled to the string</p>
<p class="t0">Drew iron tears down Pluto&rsquo;s cheek,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>is accompanied by long persistent trills that admirably
suit the words. The next number (&ldquo;Populous
Cities please me then&rdquo;) is a very descriptive solo
for Allegro, with chorus which begins in canon form
for the voices and then turns to a lively movement
as it pictures the knights celebrating their triumphs
and the &ldquo;store of ladies&rdquo; awarding prizes to their
gallants. Again Allegro in a graceful aria sings,
&ldquo;There let Hymen oft appear.&rdquo; It is followed
by a charming canzonet (&ldquo;Hide me from Day&rsquo;s
garish Eye&rdquo;) for Penseroso, which leads to an
aria for Allegro (&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll to the well-trod Stage
anon&rdquo;), opening in genuinely theatrical style, and
then changing to a delightfully melodious warble
at the words,&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Or sweetest Shakspeare, Fancy&rsquo;s child,</p>
<p class="t0">Warble his native wood-notes wild.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is followed by three characteristic arias, &ldquo;And
ever, against eating Cares,&rdquo; &ldquo;Orpheus himself may
heave his Head,&rdquo; and &ldquo;These Delights, if thou
canst give,&rdquo;&mdash;the last with chorus. Penseroso has
a short chorus in plain but stately harmony (&ldquo;There
<span class="pb" id="pg_184">[184]</span>
let the pealing Organ blow&rdquo;), with pauses for the
organ <i>ad libitum</i>, followed by the aria, &ldquo;May at last
my weary Age,&rdquo; and the majestic devotional fugued
chorus, &ldquo;These Pleasures, Melancholy, give!&rdquo;
which close the second part.</p>
<p>The third part, &ldquo;Il Moderato,&rdquo; is rarely given,
and the work may well close with the fugue that so
beautifully and harmoniously ends the second part.
It opens with an aria in which Moderato tenders the
sage advice:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come, with native lustre shine,</p>
<p class="t0">Moderation, grace divine,</p>
<p class="t0">Whom the wise God of nature gave,</p>
<p class="t0">Mad mortals from themselves to save.</p>
<p class="t0">Keep as of old the middle way,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor deeply sad nor idly gay;</p>
<p class="t0">But still the same in look and gait,</p>
<p class="t0">Easy, cheerful, and sedate,</p>
<p class="t0">Keep as of old the middle way.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>With such didactic commonplaces as the above,
Moderato commends temperance, health, contentment,
frugality, equanimity, and chaste love, and
bids them,&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come, with gentle hand restrain</p>
<p class="t0">Those who fondly court their bane;</p>
<p class="t0">One extreme with caution shunning,</p>
<p class="t0">To another blindly running.</p>
<p class="t0">Kindly teach how blest are they</p>
<p class="t0">Who nature&rsquo;s equal rules obey,</p>
<p class="t0">Who safely steer two rocks between,</p>
<p class="t0">And prudent keep the golden mean.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thus Mr. Jennens&rsquo;s mild philosophy goes on, one
of his verses, &ldquo;As steals the Morn upon the Night,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="pg_185">[185]</span>
set to a brilliant tenor and soprano duet, followed
by the closing chorus, &ldquo;Thy Pleasures, Moderation,
give,&rdquo; in full, broad, rich harmony. There needs no
other proof of Handel&rsquo;s genius, than that he could
link such Tupperisms to his grand measures.</p>
<div class="fnblock">
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_27" href="#fr_27">[27]</a></sup> Jennens was an amateur poet of the period, descended from a
manufacturing family of Birmingham, from whom he inherited a
large fortune. He lived on terms of close intimacy with Handel,
and was mentioned in his will. He died Nov. 20, 1773.
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_28" href="#fr_28">[28]</a></sup> I was lucky enough to meet with the approbation of Mr. Bates
in the recitative of &ldquo;Deeper and deeper still;&rdquo; my next song was
the laughing one. Mr. Harrison, my predecessor at those concerts,
was a charming singer: his singing &ldquo;Oft on a plat of rising ground,&rdquo;
his &ldquo;Lord, remember David,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O come let us worship and fall
down,&rdquo; breathed pure religion. No divine from the pulpit, though
gifted with the greatest eloquence, could have inspired his auditors
with a more perfect sense of duty to their Maker than Harrison
did by his melodious tones and chaste style; indeed, it was faultless:
but in the animated songs of Handel he was very deficient.
I heard him sing the laughing song without moving a muscle, and
determined, though it was a great risk, to sing it my own way, and
the effect produced justified the experiment; instead of singing it
with the serious tameness of Harrison, I laughed all through it, as
I conceived it ought to be sung, and as must have been the intention
of the composer. The infection ran; and their Majesties, and the
whole audience, as well as the orchestra, were in a roar of laughter,
and a signal was given from the royal box to repeat it, and I sang
it again with increased effect.&mdash;<i>Michael Kelly&rsquo;s Reminiscences</i>,

<h3>HATTON.</h3>
<p>John Liphot Hatton, a composer
well known in America, not only by his
songs and other works, but also by his
visits here, was born in Liverpool in 1809.
Though his early musical education was very scanty,
he soon became known as a composer after his removal
to London in 1832, and his works met with a
very cordial reception. In 1842 he became conductor
at Drury Lane Theatre, and while acting in that
capacity brought out one of his operettas, called
&ldquo;The Queen of the Thames.&rdquo; In 1844 he went
to Vienna and produced his opera &ldquo;Pascal Bruno.&rdquo;
Shortly afterwards he issued several songs under the
<i>nom de plume</i> of &ldquo;Czapek,&rdquo; which secured for themselves
widespread popularity. In 1848 he came to
this country, and some years later made a concert-tour
here. Upon his return to England he assumed
direction of the music at the Princess&rsquo; Theatre, and
while engaged there wrote incidental music for
&ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sardanapalus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Faust and Marguerite,&rdquo;
&ldquo;King Henry VIII.,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pizarro,&rdquo; &ldquo;King
Richard II.,&rdquo; &ldquo;King Lear,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Merchant of
<span class="pb" id="pg_187">[187]</span>
Venice,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Much Ado About Nothing.&rdquo; In
1856 he wrote &ldquo;Robin Hood,&rdquo; a cantata; in 1864
the opera &ldquo;Rose, or Love&rsquo;s Ransom,&rdquo; for Covent
Garden; and in 1877 &ldquo;Hezekiah,&rdquo; a sacred drama,
which was performed at the Crystal Palace. He
has also written a large number of part songs, which
are great favorites with quartet clubs, and nearly
two hundred songs which are very popular; among
them, &ldquo;Good-by, Sweetheart, good-by,&rdquo; which has
been a stock piece with concert tenors for years,
and which the late Signor Brignoli used to sing with
excellent effect. His music is specially characterized
by grace and melodiousness. Hatton died
in 1886.</p>
</div>
<div id="c057" title="Robin Hood">
<h4>Robin Hood.</h4>
<p>The pastoral cantata of &ldquo;Robin Hood&rdquo; was
written for the Bradford (England) Triennial Festival
of 1856, Sims Reeves creating the part of the
hero. Its name suggests the well-known story of
the greenwood outlaw which has been charmingly
versified by George Linley in the libretto. The
personages are Maid Marian, Robin Hood, Little
John, and &ldquo;The Bishop.&rdquo; Maid Marian, it will be
remembered, was the mistress who followed Robin
into the Sherwood Forest and shared his wild life;
and Little John was his stalwart lieutenant, whose
name was transposed after he joined the band, thus
heightening the incongruity between his name and
his great size. The incident contained in Linley&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="pg_188">[188]</span>
poem appears to have been suggested by Robin
Hood&rsquo;s penchant for capturing bishops and other
ecclesiastics, notwithstanding his religious professions,
which were exemplified by the retention of
Friar Tuck as chaplain in the bold archer&rsquo;s household;
or it may be based upon the historical story of
the expedition which Edward II. and some of his
retainers, disguised as monks, made into the forest
for the purpose of exterminating the outlaws and
thus stopping their slaughter of the royal deer. As
the old story goes, they were led into an ambuscade
by a forester who had agreed to conduct them to
the haunts of Robin, and were captured. When
Robin recognized the King in the disguise of the
abbot, he craved forgiveness for himself and his
band, which was granted upon condition that he
should accompany his sovereign to Court and take
a place in the royal household. The old collection
of ballads, &ldquo;The Lytell Geste of Robyn Hood,&rdquo; tells
the same story and continues it, relating how after
&ldquo;dwelling in the Kynge&rsquo;s courte&rdquo; a year, he tired
of it and obtained permission to make a visit to the
woods again, but forfeited his word and never returned,
dying at last in Kirklees priory, through the
treachery of the abbess, and how in his last moments
he blew a loud blast on his horn, summoning Little
John from the forest, to whom, after he had forced
his way into his chamber, the dying Robin said:</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Give me my bent bow in my hand,</p>
<p class="t">And an arrow I&rsquo;ll let free,</p>
<p class="t0">And where that arrow is taken up,</p>
<p class="t">There let my grave digged be.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_189">[189]</div>
<p>The cantata opens with a chorus of the outlaws,
who vigorously assert their independence of tribute,
laws, and monarchs, followed by a bombastic bass
aria by the Bishop, who threatens them for destroying
the King&rsquo;s deer. His grandiloquence is speedily
interrupted by the outlaws, with Robin at their head,
who surround him without further ado and make
him the butt of their sport. Robin Hood sings a
charmingly melodious ballad, &ldquo;Under the Greenwood
Tree,&rdquo; in which the Bishop is invited to become
one of their number and share their sylvan
enjoyments. A trio and chorus follow, in the course
of which the Bishop parts with his personal possessions
in favor of the gentlemen around him in Lincoln
green with &ldquo;bent bows.&rdquo; A chorus (&ldquo;Strike
the Harp&rdquo;) also informs us that the ecclesiastic is
forced to dance for the genial band much against
his will as well as his dignity. Robin&rsquo;s sentimentalizing
about the pleasures under the greenwood
tree is still further emphasized by a madrigal for
female voices, supposed to be sung by the forest
maidens, though their identity is not very clear, as
Marian was the only maid that accompanied the
band. After the plundering scene, the cantata
grows more passionate in character, describing a
pretty and tender love-scene between Robin and
Marian, which is somewhat incongruous, whether
Marian be considered as the outlaw&rsquo;s mistress, or,
as some of the old chroniclers have it, his wife
Matilda, who changed her name when she followed
him into the forest. From the musical standpoint,
<span class="pb" id="pg_190">[190]</span>
however, it affords an opportunity for another graceful
ballad of sentiment, in which Marian describes
her heart as &ldquo;a frail bark upon the waters of love;&rdquo;
a duet in which the lovers passionately declare their
love for each other as well as their delight with the
forest; and a final chorus of the band, jubilantly
proclaiming their hatred of kings and courtiers, and
their loyalty to Robin Hood and Maid Marian.
It may be worthy of note in this connection that
Bishop, the English composer, wrote a legendary
opera called &ldquo;Maid Marian, or the Huntress of
Arlingford,&rdquo; in which the heroine is Matilda.</p>

<h3>HAYDN.</h3>
<p>Joseph Haydn, the creator of the symphony
and the string quartet, was born
at Rohrau, a little Austrian village on the
river Leitha, March 31, 1732. His father
was a wheelwright and his mother a cook, in
service with Count Harrach. Both the parents
were fond of music, and both sang, the father
accompanying himself upon the harp, which he
played by ear. The child displayed a voice so
beautiful that in his sixth year he was allowed to
study music, and was also given a place in the village
church-choir. Reutter, the capellmeister of
St. Stephen&rsquo;s, Vienna, having heard him, was so
impressed with the beauty of his voice that he offered
him a position as chorister. Haydn eagerly
accepted it, as it gave him an opportunity for study.
While in the service of St. Stephen&rsquo;s he had lessons
on the violin and piano, as well as in composition.
When his voice broke, and his singing was of no
further value, he was thrown upon the tender mercies
of the world. Fortune favored him, however.
He obtained a few pupils, and gave himself to composition.
<span class="pb" id="pg_192">[192]</span>
He made the acquaintance of Metastasio,
Porpora, and Gluck. His trios began to attract
attention, and he soon found himself rising into
prominence. In 1759, through the influence of
a wealthy friend and amateur, he was appointed to
the post of musical director and composer in the
service of Count Morzin, and about this time wrote
his first symphony. When the Count dismissed his
band, Prince Paul Anton Esterhazy received him as
his second capellmeister, under Werner. When the
latter died, in 1766, Haydn took his place as sole
director. His patron meanwhile had died, and was
succeeded by his son Nicolaus, between whom and
Haydn there was the utmost good feeling. Up to
this time Haydn had written thirty symphonies, a
large number of trios, quartets, and several vocal
pieces. His connection with the Prince lasted
until 1790, and was only terminated by the latter&rsquo;s
death. During this period of twenty-eight years his
musical activity was unceasing; and as he had an
orchestra of his own, and his patron was ardently
devoted to music, the incentive to composition was
never lacking. Anton succeeded Nicolaus, and
was generous enough to increase Haydn&rsquo;s pension;
but he dismissed the entire chapel, and the composer
took up his abode in Vienna. He was hardly established
before he received a flattering proposition
from Salomon, the manager, to go to England. He
had already had many pressing invitations from
others, but could not accept them, owing to his engagement
to Esterhazy. Now that he was free, he
<span class="pb" id="pg_193">[193]</span>
decided to make the journey. On New Year&rsquo;s Day,
1791, he arrived in London. Success greeted him
at once. He became universally popular. Musicians
and musical societies paid him devoted attention.
He gave a series of symphony concerts which
aroused the greatest enthusiasm. He was treated
with distinguished courtesy by the royal family. Oxford
gave him the honorary degree of Doctor of
Music. The nobility entertained him sumptuously.
After a year of continuous f&ecirc;tes he returned to
Germany, where he remained two years, during
a portion of which time Beethoven was his pupil.
In 1794 he made his second journey to England,
where his former successes were repeated, and
fresh honors were showered upon him. In 1804
he was notified by Prince Esterhazy that he was
about to reorganize his chapel, and wished him
for its conductor again. Haydn accordingly returned
to his old position, where he remained during
the rest of his life. He was already an old
man, but it was during this period that his most
remarkable works were produced, among them the
Austrian National Hymn (&ldquo;Gott erhalte Franz den
Kaiser&rdquo;), the &ldquo;Seven Words,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Creation,&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Seasons,&rdquo; and many of his best trios and
quartets. He died May 31, 1809, a few days after
the occupation of Vienna by the French, and among
the mourners at his funeral were many French
officers. Funeral services were held in all the principal
European cities. Honored and respected all
over Europe, he was most deeply loved by his own
<span class="pb" id="pg_194">[194]</span>
countrymen, who still affectionately speak of him as
&ldquo;Papa&rdquo; Haydn.</p>
</div>
<div id="c059" title="The Seven Words">
<h4>The Seven Words.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Seven Words of Jesus on the Cross,&rdquo; sometimes
called &ldquo;The Passion,&rdquo; was written by Haydn
in 1785, for the cathedral of Cadiz, upon a commission
from the chapter for appropriate music for
Good Friday. It was at first composed as an instrumental
work, consisting of seven adagio movements,
and in this form was produced in London
by the composer himself as a &ldquo;Passione instrumentale.&rdquo;
He afterwards introduced solos and choruses,
and divided it into two parts, separating them
by a largo movement for wind instruments. It was
then given at Eisenstadt in 1797, and four years
later was published in the new form, with the following
preface by the composer himself:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">About fifteen years ago I was applied to by a
clergyman in Cadiz, and requested to write instrumental
music to the seven words of Jesus on the cross. It
was then customary every year, during Lent, to perform
an Oratorio in the Cathedral at Cadiz, the effect
of which the following arrangements contributed to
heighten. The walls, windows, and columns of the
church were hung with black cloth, and only one large
lamp, hanging in the centre, lighted the solemn and
religious gloom. At noon all the doors were closed,
and the music began. After a prelude, suited to the
occasion, the bishop ascended the pulpit, pronounced
one of the seven words, which was succeeded by reflections
<span class="pb" id="pg_195">[195]</span>
upon it. As soon as these were ended he
descended from the pulpit and knelt before the altar.
The pause was filled by music. The bishop ascended
and descended again a second, a third time, and so
on; and each time the orchestra filled up the intervals
in the discourse.</p>
<p class="bq">My composition must be judged on a consideration
of these circumstances. The task of writing seven
adagios, each of which was to last about ten minutes, to
preserve a connection between them, without wearying
the hearers, was none of the lightest, and I soon found
that I could not confine myself within the limits of the
time prescribed.</p>
<p class="bq">The music was originally without text, and was
printed in that form. It was only at a later period
that I was induced to add the text. The Oratorio entitled
&ldquo;The Seven Words of our Redeemer on the
Cross,&rdquo; as a complete and, as regards the vocal parts,
an entirely new work, was first published by Messrs.
Breitkopf and H&auml;rtel, of Leipsic. The partiality with
which this work has been received by scientific musicians
leads me to hope that it will not be without
effect on the public at large.</p>
<div class="bq">
<p class="jr"><span class="sc">Joseph Haydn.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="bq"><span class="sc">Vienna</span>, March 1, 1880.</p>
<p class="tb">As the various movements are all of the same
general tone and character, though varied with all
that skill and mastery of instrumental effect for
which Haydn was so conspicuous, it is needless to
describe each separately. By many of the musicians
of his day it was considered one of his most sublime
productions; and Bombet declares that Haydn
on more than one occasion, when he was asked to
<span class="pb" id="pg_196">[196]</span>
which of his works he gave the preference, replied,
&ldquo;The Seven Words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It opens with an adagio for full orchestra, of a
very sorrowful but impressive character. Then follow
each of the Seven Words, given out in simple
chorale form, followed by its chorus, namely:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<p class="center">I.
<br /><span class="small">PATIENCE.</span></p>
<p class="tm1">&ldquo;Father, forgive them; for they know not what they
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tm1"><i>Chorus</i>: &ldquo;Lamb of God! Surely Thou hast borne
our sorrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">II.
<br /><span class="small">THE PENITENT FORGIVEN.</span></p>
<p class="tm1">&ldquo;Verily I say unto thee, this day shalt thou be with
me in Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tm1"><i>Chorus</i>: &ldquo;Lord, have mercy on me after Thy great
goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">III.
<br /><span class="small">THE MOURNERS.</span></p>
<p class="tm1">&ldquo;Woman, behold thy Son. Son, behold Thy
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tm1"><i>Chorus</i>: &ldquo;Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
not for Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">IV.
<br /><span class="small">DESOLATION.</span></p>
<p class="tm1">&ldquo;Eli, Eli, lama sabacthani?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tm1"><i>Chorus</i>: &ldquo;O my God, look upon Me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_197">[197]</div>
<p class="center">V.
<br /><span class="small">THE BITTER CUP.</span></p>
<p class="tm1">&ldquo;I thirst.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tm1"><i>Chorus</i>: &ldquo;He treadeth the
winepress of the fierceness and wrath.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">VI.
<br /><span class="small">COMPLETE OBEDIENCE.</span></p>
<p class="tm1">&ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tm1"><i>Chorus</i>: &ldquo;He came down from Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center">VII.
<br /><span class="small">THE GREAT OBLATION.</span></p>
<p class="tm1">&ldquo;Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tm1"><i>Chorus</i>: &ldquo;Into Thy hands, O Lord.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Following immediately after the last number the
whole spirit of the music changes with the chorus,
&ldquo;The Veil of the Temple was rent in twain,&rdquo; a
presto movement, sung fortissimo, describing the
darkness, the quaking of the earth, the rending of
the rocks, the opening of the graves, and the arising
of the bodies of the saints who slept, with all that
vividness in imitation and sublimity of effect which
characterize so many of the composer&rsquo;s passages in
&ldquo;The Creation&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Seasons.&rdquo; Haydn was
by nature a deeply religious man, and that he felt
the inspiration of the solemn subject is shown by
the manner in which he conceived it, and by the exalted
devotion of the music which accompanies the
<span class="pb" id="pg_198">[198]</span>
last words of the Man of Sorrows. The lines which
Bombet quotes from Dante in this connection are
hardly exaggerated:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;He with such piety his thought reveals,</p>
<p class="t0">And with such heavenly sweetness clothes each tone,</p>
<p class="t0">That hell itself the melting influence feels.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c060" title="Ariadne">
<h4>Ariadne.</h4>
<p>The cantata &ldquo;Ariana a Naxos&rdquo; was written in
1792, and is for a single voice with orchestra. As
an illustration of the original cantata form, it is one
of the most striking and perfect. Its story is an
episode familiar in mythology. When Minos, King
of Crete, had vanquished the Athenians, he imposed
upon &AElig;geus, their king, the severe penalty that seven
youths should be annually sent to Crete to be devoured
by the Minotaur. In the fourth year the
king&rsquo;s son, Theseus, was among the number. He
was more fortunate than his predecessors, for he slew
the Minotaur and was rescued from the labyrinth by
following the thread of Ariadne, daughter of Minos,
who had conceived a violent passion for the handsome
warrior, conqueror of Centaurs and Amazons.
Upon his return to Athens she accompanied him as
far as the island Naxos, where the ungrateful wretch
perfidiously left her. It is this scene of desertion
which Haydn chose for his cantata.</p>
<p>Ariadne is supposed to have just awakened from
sleep and reclines upon a mossy bank. The first
<span class="pb" id="pg_199">[199]</span>
number is a recitative and largo in which she hopefully
calls upon Theseus to return. The melody is
noble and spirited in style, and yet tender and fervent
in its expression of love for the absent one.
In the next number, a recitative and andante (&ldquo;No
one listens! My sad Words Echo but repeats&rdquo;),
hopefulness turns to anxiety. The contrast between
the blissful longing of the one and the growing solicitude
expressed in the other number is very striking.
The next melody, an <i>allegro vivace</i>,&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;What see I? O heavens! Unhappy me!</p>
<p class="t0">Those are the sails of the Argosy! Greeks are those yonder!</p>
<p class="t0">Theseus! &rsquo;Tis he stands at the prow,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>is remarkable for its passionate intensity and dramatic
strength. The clouds of despair close over
her, and she calls down the vengeance of the gods
upon the deserter. In the next two numbers, an
adagio (&ldquo;To whom can I turn me?&rdquo;), and an andante
(&ldquo;Ah! how for Death I am longing&rdquo;), the
melodies closely follow the sentiment of the text,
accompanied by very expressive instrumentation.
An <i>allegro presto</i>, infused with the very spirit of
hopeless gloom and despair, ends the cantata:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Woe&rsquo;s me! deceived, betrayed!</p>
<p class="t0">Earth holds no consolation.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the mythological version, however, consolation
came; for Bacchus, &ldquo;ever young,&rdquo; and full of pity
for lorn maids, married her, and gave her a crown
of seven stars, which after her death was placed
among the constellations. The music presents many
<span class="pb" id="pg_200">[200]</span>
difficulties for a singer, as it requires the noblest
style of declamation, peculiar refinement of sentiment,
and rare musical intelligence, as well as facility
in execution to give expression to its recitative
and strongly contrasting melodies, which have no
unity of key, but follow the varying sentiments, with
their changes of tone-color, as closely as Theseus
followed his thread.</p>

<h3>HILLER.</h3>
<p>Ferdinand Hiller, one of the most
eminent of modern German composers,
and a writer of more than ordinary ability,
was born at Frankfort-on-the-Main,
Oct. 24, 1811. His musical talent displayed itself
so early that in his tenth year he appeared in concerts.
In 1825 he began his studies with Hummel,
and two years afterwards accompanied him on a
concert-tour to Vienna, where he published his first
work, a piano-forte quartet. He next went to Paris,
where he remained until 1835, occupying for a
time the position of professor in Choron&rsquo;s &ldquo;Institution
de Musique,&rdquo; but principally devoting himself
to piano-playing, composition, and concerts.
In 1836 he returned to Frankfort, and for more
than a year conducted the concerts of the C&oelig;cilienverein.
He then went to Milan, where he met
Rossini, and with his assistance brought out his
opera &ldquo;Romilda&rdquo; at La Scala, but without much
success. About the same time he began his oratorio
&ldquo;The Destruction of Jerusalem,&rdquo; one of his
most important works. In 1841 he made a second
<span class="pb" id="pg_202">[202]</span>
journey to Italy and gave particular attention to
church music. On his return he first resided at
Frankfort, but was soon in Leipsic, where he conducted
the Gewandhaus concerts (1843-44), and
after that time in Dresden, where he produced two
more operas, &ldquo;Traum in der Christ-nacht&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Conradin.&rdquo; In 1847 he was appointed municipal
capellmeister at D&uuml;sseldorf, and three years later
took a similar position at Cologne, where he organized
the Conservatory. In that city he exercised
a widespread influence, not alone by his
teaching, but also by his direction of the famous
Lower Rhine festivals. He also made many
musical tours which increased his fame. In
1852-53 he conducted opera in Paris; in 1870,
gave a series of successful concerts in St. Petersburg;
and in 1871-72 visited England, where he
produced his works both in public concerts and
festivals. His compositions are very numerous,
including among the most prominent, five operas,
four overtures, a festival march for the opening
of the Albert Hall, the Spring Symphony, the

<div id="c062" title="Song of Victory">
<h4>Song of Victory.</h4>
<p>The &ldquo;Song of Victory,&rdquo; a cantata for soprano
solo, chorus, and orchestra, was first produced at
the Cologne Festival of 1871, and was written to
celebrate the victorious conclusion of the Franco-German
war of 1870. It consists of eight numbers,
all of which are sacred in character, though
their purpose is to express gratitude and joy over
the triumph of the German arms.</p>
<p>The opening number is a vigorous, jubilant
chorus (&ldquo;The Lord great Wonders for us hath
wrought&rdquo;). It begins with a slow movement in
massive chords, gathering animation as it proceeds,
and closing pianissimo on the words, &ldquo;There is
none that searcheth or understandeth.&rdquo; The second
number is a soprano solo and chorus (&ldquo;Praise,
O Jerusalem, praise the Lord&rdquo;) declamatory in
style. The third (&ldquo;The Heathen are fallen in the
Pit&rdquo;) is assigned to chorus, and is the most dramatic
in the work, describing as it does the terrors
of war. In the fourth (&ldquo;See, it is written in the
Book of the Righteous&rdquo;), a short soprano solo, the
melody is a tender lament for the dead. The fifth
(&ldquo;He in Tears that soweth&rdquo;) is a soprano solo
with chorus of first and second sopranos and altos.
In this number lamentation gives way to hope and
gladness, leading up to the last three numbers,&mdash;the
<span class="pb" id="pg_204">[204]</span>
six-part chorus (&ldquo;Mighty is our God&rdquo;), full
of effective sustained harmony, and the soprano
solos and choruses of praise and hallelujah which
resume the triumphant style of the opening chorus
with increased power and enthusiasm.</p>

<h3>HOFMANN.</h3>
<p>Heinrich Karl Johann Hofmann
was born Jan. 13, 1842, at
Berlin. In his younger days he was a
scholar at the Kullak Conservatory, and
studied composition with Grell, Dehn, and W&uuml;erst.
Prior to 1873 he devoted himself to private instruction,
but since that time he has been engaged exclusively
in composition. Among his works which
first attracted public attention by their intrinsic excellence
as well as by the knowledge of orchestration
which they displayed, were an &ldquo;Hungarian
Suite&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Frithjof Symphony.&rdquo; Among his
piano compositions are the following four-handed
pieces, which have been remarkably popular:
&ldquo;Italienische Liebesnovelle,&rdquo; &ldquo;Liebesfr&uuml;hling,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Trompeter von S&auml;ckingen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Steppenbilder,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Aus meinem Tagebuch.&rdquo; His choral works
are &ldquo;Nonnengesang,&rdquo; &ldquo;Die Sch&ouml;ne Melusine,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Aschenbr&ouml;del,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cinderella.&rdquo; Among his
operas are &ldquo;Cartouche&rdquo; (1869), &ldquo;Armin&rdquo; (1878),
and &ldquo;Annchen von Tharau&rdquo; (1878). He has
also written several works for mixed chorus and
<span class="pb" id="pg_206">[206]</span>
m&auml;nnerchor, piano pieces, songs, duets, a violoncello
concerto, piano trios and quartets, and a
string sextet.</p>
</div>
<div id="c064" title="Melusina">
<h4>Melusina.</h4>
<p>The beautiful story of Melusina has always had
an attraction for artists and musicians. Moritz von
Schwind, the painter, has illustrated it in a cycle
of frescos; Julius Zellner has told it for us in a
series of orchestral tone-pictures; and Mendelssohn
has chosen it as the subject of one of his most
charming overtures. The version which Hofmann
uses in his cantata entitled &ldquo;The Fable of the
Fair Melusina&rdquo; (written in 1875) runs as follows:
Melusina, the nymph of a beautiful fountain in the
Bressilian forest, and Count Raymond have fallen in
love with each other. They declare their passion
in the presence of her nymphs, and plight their
troth. Melusina engages to be his dutiful wife the
first six days of the week, but makes Raymond
promise never to inquire or seek to discover what
she does on the seventh, which, she assures him,
shall &ldquo;never see her stray from the path of duty.&rdquo;
On that day she must assume her original form,
half fish and half woman, and bathe with her
nymphs. Raymond promises, calls his hunters, introduces
his bride to them, and the wedding cort&egrave;ge
moves joyfully on to the castle. In the second
part Raymond&rsquo;s mother, Clotilda, and her brother,
Sintram, intrigue against Melusina. They denounce
<span class="pb" id="pg_207">[207]</span>
her as a witch, and the accusation seems to be
justified by a drought which has fallen upon the
land since the marriage. The suffering people
loudly clamor for the surrender of the &ldquo;foul witch.&rdquo;
After long resistance Raymond is induced to break
into the bathing-house which he had erected over
the fountain. Melusina and her nymphs, surprised
by him, call upon the king of the water-spirits
to avenge his treason. The king appears and consigns
him to death. Seized with pity, Melusina
intercedes for him, and the king agrees to spare
his life upon condition that they shall separate.
Raymond once more embraces her, neither of
them knowing that it will be fatal to him, dies in
her arms, and the sorrowing Melusina returns to
the flood.</p>
<p>The prologue describes Melusina&rsquo;s fountain, and
contains a leading motive which characterizes Raymond.
The chorus part is very romantic in its
style, and is set to a graceful, poetical accompaniment.
The opening number introduces Melusina
and her nymphs in a chorus extolling their watery
abode (&ldquo;For the Flood is life-giving&rdquo;). In the second
number she describes the passion she feels when
thinking of Raymond. The song is interrupted by
horn signals indicating the approach of her lover and
his hunters, who join in a fresh, vigorous hunting-song
and then disperse. In the fourth number Raymond
gives expression to his love for Melusina,
followed by a fervid duet between them, in which
the lovers interchange vows of constancy. The sixth
number, describing their engagement in presence of
<span class="pb" id="pg_208">[208]</span>
the nymphs, and concluding with a stirring chorus
of nymphs and hunters, closes the first part.</p>
<p>The second part begins with a theme from the love-duet,
followed by a significant theme in the minor,
ominous of approaching danger. In the eighth
number the people clamor in furious chorus for
the witch. In the ninth, a trio and chorus, Clotilda
warns her son of the misery he has brought
upon his house and people, and urges him to discover
what his wife does on the seventh day. The
next number introduces Melusina and her nymphs
in the bath, the former singing a plaintive song
(&ldquo;Love is freighted with Sorrow and Care&rdquo;). A
noise is heard at the gate, and the nymphs join in
a chorus in canon form (&ldquo;Hark! hark! Who
has come to watch&rdquo;). As Raymond appears, the
scene grows very dramatic. The king of the water-spirits
is summoned; but before he rises from the
water Melusina, in very melodious recitative, laments
her lover&rsquo;s treason. The scene culminates
in the sentence, &ldquo;Let Death be his lot.&rdquo; He is
spared by her intercession, but she is commanded
to return to the flood. Raymond appeals
for forgiveness, and a part of the love-duet is repeated.
The final embrace is fatal to him, and he
dies in her arms. The chorus repeats the melody of
the opening number (&ldquo;For the Flood is life-giving&rdquo;),
and she bids her dead lover a last farewell,
and disappears with the nymphs and water-spirits,
singing, &ldquo;Forget with the Dwellers on
Earth all earthly Woe.&rdquo; The epilogue is substantially
the same as the prologue.</p>

<h3>LESLIE.</h3>
<p>Henry David Leslie was born in
London, June 18, 1822, and in his sixteenth
year began his musical studies
with Charles Lucas, a famous violoncellist
and for a long time principal of the Royal
Academy of Music. Like his master, Leslie played
the violoncello several years in the concerts of the
Sacred Harmonic Society, subsequently becoming
its conductor,&mdash;a position which he held until
1861. In 1855 he organized the famous Leslie
choir of one hundred voices, which took the first
prize at the international competition of 1878 in
Paris. In 1863 he was chosen conductor of the
Herefordshire Philharmonic Society, and in the
following year became principal of the National
College of Music. In 1874 he was appointed conductor
of the Guild of Amateur Musicians in London.
He has been a prolific and very popular
composer, among his works being the following:
Te Deum and Jubilate in D (1846); symphony in
F (1847); anthem, &ldquo;Let God arise&rdquo; (1849);
overture, &ldquo;The Templar&rdquo; (1852); oratorio, &ldquo;Immanuel&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="pg_210">[210]</span>
(1853); operetta, &ldquo;Romance, or Bold
Dick Turpin&rdquo; (1857); oratorio, &ldquo;Judith,&rdquo; written
for the Birmingham Festival (1858); cantata, &ldquo;Holyrood&rdquo;
(1860); cantata, &ldquo;The Daughter of the
Isles&rdquo; (1861); and the opera &ldquo;Ida&rdquo; (1864). In
addition to these he has written a large number of
songs, anthems, part songs, madrigals, and piano
pieces, besides music for his choir.</p>
</div>
<div id="c066" title="Holyrood">
<h4>Holyrood.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Holyrood&rdquo; was written in 1861, and was first
produced in February of that year at St. James&rsquo;s
Hall, London. Leslie&rsquo;s collaborator was the accomplished
scholar Chorley, who has certainly prepared
one of the most refined and attractive librettos ever
furnished a composer. The story represents an
episode during the period of Queen Mary&rsquo;s innocent
life, overshadowed in the close by the dismal
prophecy of the terrible fate so rapidly approaching
her. The characters are Queen Mary (soprano),
Mary Beatoun (Beton), her maid of honor (contralto);
Rizzio, the ill-fated minstrel (tenor); and
John Knox (bass). The scene is laid in a court of
the palace of Holyrood, and introduces a coterie of
the court ladies and gentlemen engaged in one
of those joyous revels of which Mary was so fond.
In the midst of the pleasantry, however, the Queen
moves pensively about, overcome with sadness, as
if her thoughts were far away. Her favorite maid
tries in vain to rouse her from her melancholy with
<span class="pb" id="pg_211">[211]</span>
a Scotch ballad. The minstrel Rizzio is then urged
to try his skill. He takes his lute and sings an
Italian canzonet which has the desired effect. The
sensuous music of the South diverts her. She expresses
her delight, and seizing his lute sings her
new joy in a French romance. It is interrupted by
a Puritan psalm of warning heard outside. The
revellers seek to drown it; but it grows in power, and
only ceases when the leader, John Knox, enters
with stern and forbidding countenance. The Queen
is angry at first, but bids him welcome provided his
mission is a kindly one. He answers with a warning.
As he has the gift of prophecy, she orders him
to read her future. After the bridal, the murder of
the bridegroom; after the murder, battle; after
the battle, prison; after the prison, the scaffold,
is the tragic fate he foresees. The enraged courtiers
call for his arrest and punishment, but the light-hearted
Queen bids him go free:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Let him go, and hear our laughter!</p>
<p class="t0">Mirth to-day, whate&rsquo;er come after.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The cantata opens with a chorus for female voices
in three divisions, with a contralto solo, in the Scotch
style:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The mavis carols in the shaw,</p>
<p class="t0">The leaves are green on every tree,</p>
<p class="t0">And June, whose car the sunbeams draw,</p>
<p class="t0">Is dropping gold on bank and lea;</p>
<p class="t0">The hind is merry in the mead,</p>
<p class="t">The child that gathers gowan flower,</p>
<p class="t0">The Thane upon his prancing steed,</p>
<p class="t">The high-born lady in her bower,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t3">Gay, gay, all are gay,</p>
<p class="t3">On this happy summer day.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_212">[212]</div>
<p>After a short recitative passage in which Mary
Beatoun appeals to the revellers to lure the Queen
from her loneliness, and their reply (&ldquo;O Lady, never
sit alone&rdquo;), the maid sings a very characteristic and
engaging Scotch ballad:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;There once was a maiden in Melrose town</p>
<p class="t">(Oh! the bright Tweed is bonny to see!)</p>
<p class="t0">Who looked on the best in the country down,</p>
<p class="t">Because she had lovers, one, two, three.</p>
<p class="t0">The first was a lord with his chest of gold,</p>
<p class="t">The second a ruddy shepherd so tall,</p>
<p class="t0">The third was a spearsman bluff and bold,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">But Pride, it goeth before a fall.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;One hour she smil&egrave;d, the next she wept</p>
<p class="t">(Oh! the bright Tweed is bonny to see!)</p>
<p class="t0">And with frowns and blushes a chain she kept</p>
<p class="t">Round the necks of her hapless lovers three.</p>
<p class="t0">For the lord in her lap poured wide his gold,</p>
<p class="t">And the shepherd ran at her beck and call,</p>
<p class="t0">And the spearsman swore she was curst and cold,</p>
<p class="t">But Pride, it goeth before a fall.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;At last it fell out on a bleak March day</p>
<p class="t">(Oh! the bright Tweed is bonny to see!)</p>
<p class="t0">There sate at her window the maiden gay</p>
<p class="t">And looked o&rsquo;er the frost for her lovers three.</p>
<p class="t0">But the lord had to France sailed forth with his gold,</p>
<p class="t">And the shepherd had married her playmate small,</p>
<p class="t0">And the spearsman in battle lay stark and cold,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">So Pride, it goeth before a fall.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As might have been expected, this mournful
ditty fails to rouse the Queen from her melancholy,
whereupon Rizzio takes his lute and sings the canzonet
&ldquo;Calla stagion novella,&rdquo; a very slow and
graceful movement, closing with a sensuous allegro,
<span class="pb" id="pg_213">[213]</span>
written in the genuine Italian style, though rather
Verdi-ish for the times of Rizzio. The canzonet
has the desired effect, and is followed by a delightful
French romance, sung by the Queen, in which a
tender minor theme is set off against a fascinating
waltz melody, closing with a brilliant finale:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In my pleasant land of France</p>
<p class="t">There is gladness everywhere;</p>
<p class="t0">In the very streams a dance,</p>
<p class="t">Full of life, yet debonair,</p>
<p class="t0">Ah, me! ah, me!</p>
<p class="t">To have left it was a sin,</p>
<p class="t0">Even for this kind countrie.</p>
<p class="t">But we will not mourn to-day,</p>
<p class="t">Bid the harp and rebec play,</p>
<p class="t2">Merrilie, merrilie,</p>
<p class="t0">Sing and smile, and jocund be;</p>
<p class="t0">If my father&rsquo;s land is dear,</p>
<p class="t0">Mirth and valor still are here;</p>
<p class="t0">Maidens faithful, champions gay,</p>
<p class="t0">France has melted far away</p>
<p class="t2">Beyond the sea.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At the close of the pretty romance, the revel
begins with a stately minuet and vocal trio (&ldquo;Fal,
lal, la&rdquo;) for the Queen, Mary Beatoun, and Rizzio.
It is interrupted by the unison psalm-tune of the
Puritans, a stern, severe old melody set to a &ldquo;moving
bass&rdquo; accompaniment:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O thou who sittest on the throne</p>
<p class="t">And wilt exalt thine horn on high,</p>
<p class="t0">While captive men in prison groan,</p>
<p class="t">And women poor of hunger die,</p>
<p class="t0">Beware! albeit a Haman proud,</p>
<p class="t">Served by thy slaves on bended knee,</p>
<p class="t0">The heaven can speak in thunder loud</p>
<p class="t">And rend to dust both them and thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_214">[214]</div>
<p>There is a temporary pause in the revels, but at
the Queen&rsquo;s command they are resumed with a quick-step
introduced by the pipes and full of the genuine
Scotch spirit and bustle, the &ldquo;Fal lal&rdquo; trio and
chorus still accompanying it. It is interrupted afresh
by a repetition of the psalm (&ldquo;A Hand of Fire
was on the Wall&rdquo;), after which John Knox enters.
With his entrance the gay music closes and the
work assumes a gloomy tragic cast as the dialogue
proceeds and the terrible incidents of the prophecy
are unfolded. It is a relief when they join in a
hopeful duet (&ldquo;E&rsquo;en if Earth should wholly fail
me&rdquo;) which is very quiet and melodious. It leads
to the Queen&rsquo;s farewell, a quaintly-written bit, with
an old-fashioned cadenza, followed by the final
chorus, which takes up a theme in the same joyous
spirit as the opening one:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hence with evil omen,</p>
<p class="t">Doleful bird of night,</p>
<p class="t0">Who in tears of women</p>
<p class="t">Takest chief delight!</p>
<p class="t0">Think not to alarm her,</p>
<p class="t">As with mystic power;</p>
<p class="t0">Nought shall ever harm her,</p>
<p class="t">Scotland&rsquo;s lily flower.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>LISZT.</h3>
<p>Franz Liszt, the most eminent pianist of
his time, who also obtained world-wide
celebrity as a composer and orchestral
conductor, was born at Raiding, Hungary,
Oct. 22, 1811. His father was an accomplished
amateur, and played the piano and violoncello
with more than ordinary skill. He was so impressed
with the promise of his son that he not only gave
him lessons in music, but also devoted himself to his
artistic progress with the utmost assiduity. In his
ninth year Liszt played for the first time in public
at Oedenburg. His performances aroused such enthusiasm
that several Hungarian noblemen encouraged him
to continue his studies, and guaranteed
him sufficient to defray the expenses of six years&rsquo;
tuition. He went to Vienna at once and studied
the piano with Czerny, besides taking lessons in
composition of Salieri and Randhartinger. It was
while in that city that his first composition, a variation
on a waltz of Diabelli, appeared. In 1823 he
went to Paris, hoping to secure permission to enter
the Conservatory; but Cherubini refused it on
<span class="pb" id="pg_216">[216]</span>
account of his foreign origin, though Cherubini himself
was a foreigner. Nothing daunted, young Liszt
continued his studies with Reicha and Paer, and
two years afterwards brought out a two-act opera
entitled &ldquo;Don Sancho,&rdquo; which met with a very
cordial reception. The slight he received from
Cherubini aroused popular sympathy for him. His
wonderful playing attracted universal attention and
gained him admission into the most brilliant Parisian
salons. He was a favorite with every one, especially
with the ladies. For two or three years he made
artistic tours through France, Switzerland, and England,
accompanied by his father, and everywhere
met with the most brilliant success. In 1827 the
father died, leaving him alone in the world; but
good fortune was on his side. During his stay in
Paris he had made the friendship of Victor Hugo,
George Sand, Lamartine, and other great lights in
literature and music, and their influence prepared
the way for his permanent success. From 1839 to
1847 he travelled from one city to another, arousing
the most extraordinary enthusiasm; his progress
was one continued ovation. In 1849 he went to
Weimar and accepted the post of conductor at the
Court Theatre. He made that city the musical centre
of Europe. It was there that his greatest compositions
were written, that the school of the music
of the future was founded, and that Wagner&rsquo;s operas
first gained an unprejudiced hearing; and it is
from Weimar that his distinguished pupils, like Von
B&uuml;low, Tausig, Bendel, Bronsart, Klindworth, Winterberger,
<span class="pb" id="pg_217">[217]</span>
Reubke, and many others date their success.
In 1859 he resigned his position and after
that time resided at Rome, Pesth, and Weimar,
working for the best interest of his beloved art, and
encouraging young musicians to reach the highest
standards. Few men of this century have had such
a powerful influence upon music, or have done so
much to elevate and purify it. His most important
works were the &ldquo;Divina Commedia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Faust&rdquo;
symphonies, the twelve symphonic poems, the six
Hungarian rhapsodies, the &ldquo;Graner Mass,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Hungarian Coronation Mass,&rdquo; and the oratorios
&ldquo;Christus&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Legend of the Holy Elizabeth.&rdquo;
Besides these he wrote a large number of
orchestral pieces, songs, and cantatas, and a rich and
varied collection of piano-forte solos, transcriptions,
and arrangements. He died July 31, 1886.</p>
</div>
<div id="c068" title="Prometheus">
<h4>Prometheus.</h4>
<p>Liszt&rsquo;s cantata &ldquo;Prometheus,&rdquo; composed in 1850,
is based upon the poem of the same name, written
by Johann Gottfried von Herder, the court preacher
of Weimar. The poem closely follows the well-known
legend of Prometheus&rsquo; punishment for
stealing fire from heaven, and his ultimate rescue
by Hercules from the vulture which preyed upon
his vitals. The poet pictures the victim in the
midst of his sufferings, consoled by the knowledge
<span class="pb" id="pg_218">[218]</span>
that he has been a benefactor to the human race.
The spirits of the ocean mock and menace him,
but the harvesters and tillers of the soil praise him
for the bounteous gifts he has given to the earth.
Ceres and Bacchus, protectors of the soil and its
products, also pay their tribute of sympathy to him
and thank him for the blessing of fire. Hercules
at last releases him from his torture by killing the
vulture and breaking the chains which bind him to
his rock. The sufferer is brought before Themis,
who announces that the divine wrath has been
appeased by his long punishment, and that the
gods forgive him.</p>
<p>In building up his cantata Liszt has introduced
several prologues from the poem without music,
which serve as narrators explaining the situations,
linking and leading up to the musical numbers,
which are mainly choral. Thus the opening prologue
pictures the sufferings of Prometheus, the
crime for which he is forced to endure such a
terrible penalty, and the patience, hope, and heroism
of the victim. The closing lines,&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Now through the hush of night burst well-known voices</p>
<p class="t0">Upon his ear. From out the slumbering ocean,</p>
<p class="t0">Fanning his cheek with breath of the sea waves,</p>
<p class="t0">The daughters of Oceanus approach,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>introduce the opening chorus of sea-nymphs
(&ldquo;Prometheus, Woe to thee&rdquo;), for female voices,
arranged in double parts, and set to a restless,
agitated accompaniment, expressive of fear and
despair. The second prologue, reciting the wrath
<span class="pb" id="pg_219">[219]</span>
of Oceanus &ldquo;on his swift-winged ocean steed,&rdquo; that
mortals should have dared to vex his peaceful
waters, and the reply of Prometheus that &ldquo;on the
broad earth each place is free to all,&rdquo; introduces
the choruses of Tritons and Oceanides. The first
is a mixed chorus full of brightness and spirit
(&ldquo;Freedom! afar from Land upon the open
Sea&rdquo;). Their exultant song is followed by a
fascinating melody (&ldquo;Hail! O Prometheus, hail!&rdquo;)
for female chorus, with short but expressive solos
for soprano and alto (&ldquo;When to our Waters the
golden Time shall come&rdquo;), the number closing
with double chorus in full rich harmony (&ldquo;Holy
and grand and free is the Gift of Heaven&rdquo;).
Thereupon follows the third prologue:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Scarcely has ceased the Ocean&rsquo;s song of joy,</p>
<p class="t0">Which, breathing peace unto Prometheus&rsquo; soul,</p>
<p class="t0">Wakens within his breast long-buried hope,</p>
<p class="t0">When once again the sound of lamentation</p>
<p class="t0">Bursts on his ear and fills the air with sighs.</p>
<p class="t0">Seated within a lion-drawn chariot comes</p>
<p class="t0">The founder of his race&mdash;G&aelig;a herself&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">With her a train of wood-nymphs, loudly weeping.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It introduces a chorus of Dryads (&ldquo;Woe to thee,
Prometheus&rdquo;) of the same general character as
the opening chorus of sea-nymphs, and containing
a very dramatic and declamatory alto solo
(&ldquo;Deserted stand God&rsquo;s sacred Altars in the old
Forest&rdquo;). A dialogue follows between G&aelig;a and
Prometheus, in which the latter bravely defends
his course. As the Dryads disappear, Prometheus
soliloquizes:&mdash;</p>

<p class="t6">&ldquo;&lsquo;This is, in truth, the noblest deed</p>
<p class="t0">Mortal has ever dared. Beat high, my heart!</p>
<p class="t0">On this foundation built I up my race,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">On deathless friendship and fraternity.</p>
<p class="t0">Courage, Alcides! Bravely fight thy fight.</p>
<p class="t0">Conquer, and thou shalt free me.&rsquo; From his dreams,</p>
<p class="t0">Roused is the Titan by a song of joy.</p>
<p class="t0">Before him, crowned with the rich harvest, stands</p>
<p class="t0">Ceres with her train of reapers.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A mixed chorus of gleaners follows (&ldquo;With the
Lark sweetly singing&rdquo;), which can hardly be excelled
for grace and loveliness of melody. In the
next prologue Ceres consoles Prometheus, and
while she is speaking a shout of gladness rises and
Bacchus appears. He smites the rock, and at his
touch a bower of grape-vines and ivy boughs interlaces
over the head of the Titan and shadows him.
This serves to introduce the chorus of Vine-dressers
(&ldquo;Hail to the Pleasure-giver&rdquo;), a lively strain
for male voices with an effective solo quartet. As
Prometheus resumes his soliloquy, Hermes approaches,
leading Pandora, and seeks to allure him
from his purpose by her enchantments, but in
vain:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The Titan conquers, and he feels the hour&mdash;</p>

<p class="t0">The vulture hovers, fearing to approach;</p>
<p class="t0">While the earth trembles, and the rocks are shaken.</p>
<p class="t0">Voices are heard from out the gloomy depths.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The voices are those of the spirits in the lower
regions singing a very melodramatic chorus (&ldquo;Woe!
woe! the sacred Sleep of the Dead has been disturbed&rdquo;).
<span class="pb" id="pg_221">[221]</span>
An <i>allegro moderato</i> for orchestra follows,
preluding the approach of Hercules, who
bends his giant bow and kills the vulture, strikes
the fetters off and bids him &ldquo;Go hence unto thy
Mother&rsquo;s Throne.&rdquo; The scene introduces the
seventh number (&ldquo;All human Foresight wanders
in deepest Night&rdquo;), an expressive and stately male
chorus with solo quartet. The last prologue describes
the scene at the throne of Themis, the
pardon of Prometheus, and her assurance that
&ldquo;Henceforth Olympus smiles upon the Earth.&rdquo;
Pallas presents him with a veiled figure as the
reward of his heroism, &ldquo;who will bring to thy
race the richest blessing,&mdash;Truth.&rdquo; The goddess
unveils her and declares her name &ldquo;Agathea. She
brings to man the purest, holiest gift,&mdash;Charity.&rdquo;
The closing chorus of the Muses follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Of all bright thoughts that bloom on earth,</p>

<div id="c069" title="The Bells of Strasburg">
<h4>The Bells of Strasburg.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Die Glocken des Strassburger M&uuml;nsters&rdquo;
(&ldquo;The Bells of Strasburg Cathedral&rdquo;) was written
in 1874, and is dedicated to the poet Longfellow,
from whose &ldquo;Golden Legend&rdquo; the composer took
his theme for musical treatment. The cantata,
however, does not deal with the beautiful legend
<span class="pb" id="pg_222">[222]</span>
itself as related by the old minnesinger, Hartmann
von Aue, which Longfellow has told so powerfully
in his &ldquo;Christus,&rdquo; but simply with the prologue,
describing the futile attempt of Lucifer and the
Powers of the Air to tear down the cross of the
Strasburg Cathedral during the night storm. It
was a subject peculiarly attractive to Liszt, as it
offered him free scope for his fancies and unlimited
opportunity for the display of his unique and sometimes
eccentric orchestration. The work is written
for barytone solo and mixed chorus, and is
divided into two parts,&mdash;a short prelude which is
entitled &ldquo;Excelsior&rdquo; (<i>andante maestoso</i>), and in
which this word is several times repeated by the
chorus with gradually increasing power from piano
to fortissimo; and &ldquo;The Bells,&rdquo; which comprises
the principal part of the work.</p>
<p>The second part opens with a massive introduction
(<i>allegro agitato assai</i>), in which the bells,
horns, and trumpets play an important part, leading
up to the furious invocation of Lucifer:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;Hasten! Hasten!</p>
<p class="t3">O ye spirits!</p>
<p class="t0">From its station drag the ponderous</p>
<p class="t0">Cross of iron that to mock us</p>
<p class="t0">Is uplifted high in air!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Without a break comes the response of the spirits,
first and second sopranos, altos, and tenors (&ldquo;Oh!
we cannot, for around it&rdquo;), followed by the Latin
chant of the bells sung by tenors and basses, with
a soft tremolo accompaniment:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_223">[223]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;Laudo Deum verum!</p>
<p class="t3">Plebem voco!</p>
<p class="t3">Congrego clerum!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Again with increasing power Lucifer shouts his
command:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;Lower! Lower!</p>
<p class="t3">Hover downward!</p>
<p class="t0">Seize the loud, vociferous bells, and</p>
<p class="t0">Clashing, clanging to the pavement,</p>
<p class="t0">Hurl them from their windy tower!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As before, the chorus responds in a sweet harmonious
strain (&ldquo;All thy Thunders here are harmless&rdquo;),
again followed by the slow and sonorous chant of
the bells:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;Defunctos ploro!</p>
<p class="t3">Pestem fugo!</p>
<p class="t3">Festa decoro!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lucifer reiterates his command with constantly
increasing energy:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;Shake the casements</p>
<p class="t3">Break the painted</p>
<p class="t0">Panes that flame with gold and crimson;</p>
<p class="t0">Scatter them like leaves of autumn,</p>
<p class="t0">Swept away before the blast.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In its response this time the chorus is full of energy
and impetuosity as it shouts with great power, &ldquo;O,
we cannot! the Archangel Michael flames from
every window.&rdquo; The chant of the bells is now
taken by the basses alone:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;Funera plango!</p>
<p class="t3">Fulgura frango!</p>
<p class="t3">Sabbato pango!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_224">[224]</div>
<p>Lucifer makes his last appeal with all the strength
that voice and orchestra can reach:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;Aim your lightnings</p>
<p class="t3">At the oaken</p>
<p class="t0">Massive, iron-studded portals!</p>
<p class="t0">Sack the house of God, and scatter</p>
<p class="t0">Wide the ashes of the dead.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the choral response (&ldquo;The Apostles and the
Martyrs wrapped in Mantles&rdquo;) the sopranos and
altos are in unison, making with the first and second
tenors a splendid effect. For the last time
the first and second basses sing the chant of the
bells:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;Excito lentos!</p>
<p class="t3">Dissipo ventos!</p>
<p class="t3">Paco cruentos!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>With no abatement of vigor the baffled Lucifer
sounds his signal for retreat, and the voices reply,
sopranos and altos in unison:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;Onward! onward!</p>
<p class="t3">With the night-wind,</p>
<p class="t0">Over field and farm and forest,</p>
<p class="t0">Lonely homestead, darksome hamlet,</p>
<p class="t0">Blighting all we breathe upon.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As the voices die away, choir, organ, and orchestra
join with majestic effect in the intonation of the
Gregorian chant:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">&ldquo;Nocte surgentes</p>
<p class="t3">Vigilemus omnes!</p>
<p class="t3">Laudemus Deum verum.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_225">[225]</div>
<p>The cantata shows Liszt&rsquo;s talent rather than his
genius. It is a wonderful mosaic-work of fancies,
rather than an original, studied composition with
definite purpose. Its motives, while not inspired,
are finely conceived, and are presented not only
gracefully, but in keeping with the spirituality of
the subject.</p>

<h3>MACFARREN.</h3>
<p>George Alexander Macfarren,
one of the most prominent of modern
English composers, was born in London,
March 2, 1813. He began the study of
music under the tuition of Charles Lucas in 1827.
Two years later he entered the Royal Academy of
Music, and in 1834 became one of its professors.
The latter year dates the beginning of his career as
a composer, his first work having been a symphony
in F minor. During the next thirty years his important
works were as follows: overture, &ldquo;Chevy
Chace&rdquo; (1836); &ldquo;Devil&rsquo;s Opera,&rdquo; produced at the
Lyceum (1838); &ldquo;Emblematical Tribute on the
Queen&rsquo;s Marriage&rdquo; and an arrangement of Purcell&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Dido and &AElig;neas&rdquo; (1840); editions of
&ldquo;Belshazzar,&rdquo; &ldquo;Judas Maccab&aelig;us,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jephthah,&rdquo;
for the Handel Society (1843); the opera
&ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; (1846); the opera &ldquo;Charles II.&rdquo;
(1849); serenata, &ldquo;The Sleeper Awakened,&rdquo; and
the cantata &ldquo;Lenora&rdquo; (1851); the cantata &ldquo;May
Day,&rdquo; for the Bradford Festival (1856); the cantata
&ldquo;Christmas&rdquo; (1859); the opera &ldquo;Robin
<span class="pb" id="pg_227">[227]</span>
Hood&rdquo; (1860); the masque &ldquo;Freya&rsquo;s Gift&rdquo; and
opera &ldquo;Jessy Lea&rdquo; (1863); and the operas &ldquo;She
Stoops to Conquer,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Soldier&rsquo;s Legacy,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Helvellyn&rdquo; (1864). About the last year his sight,
which had been impaired for many years, failed.
His blindness, however, did not diminish his activity.
He still served as professor in the Royal
Academy, and dictated compositions,&mdash;indeed
some of his best works were composed during this
time of affliction. In 1873 appeared his oratorio
&ldquo;St. John the Baptist,&rdquo; which met with an enthusiastic
reception at the Bristol Festival of that year.
In 1875 he was elected professor of music at Cambridge,
to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death
of Sterndale Bennett, and in the same year was also
appointed principal of the Royal Academy of Music.
In 1876 his oratorio &ldquo;The Resurrection&rdquo; was performed
at the Birmingham Festival, and in 1877
the oratorio &ldquo;Joseph&rdquo; at Leeds, besides the cantata
&ldquo;The Lady of the Lake&rdquo; at Glasgow. Grove
catalogues his other compositions as follows: a
cathedral service, anthems, chants, psalm-tunes, and
introits for the Holy Days and Seasons of the English
Church (1866); &ldquo;Songs in a Cornfield&rdquo; (1868);
&ldquo;Shakspeare Songs for Four Voices&rdquo; (1860-64);
songs from Lane&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arabian Nights,&rdquo; and Kingsley&rsquo;s
and Tennyson&rsquo;s poems: overtures to &ldquo;The
Merchant of Venice,&rdquo; &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Don Carlos;&rdquo; symphonies, string quartets,
and a quintet; a concerto for violin and orchestra;
and sonatas for piano-forte alone, and in combination
<span class="pb" id="pg_228">[228]</span>
with other instruments. As lecturer, writer,
and critic, Sir George Macfarren also holds a high
place, among his important works being &ldquo;Rudiments
of Harmony&rdquo; (1860); six Lectures on
Harmony (1867); analyses of oratorios for the
Sacred Harmonic Society (1853-57), and of orchestral
works for the Philharmonic Society (1869-71);
and a &ldquo;Musical History,&rdquo; being a reprint of
an article on this subject contributed by him to the
Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica.</p>
</div>
<div id="c071" title="Christmas">
<h4>Christmas.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas,&rdquo; the poem by John Oxenford, was
written in 1859, and was first performed at one of
the concerts of the Musical Society of London, on
the 9th of May 1860. The poem itself contains
no story. It is merely a tribute to the season; but
at the same time it is not destitute of incident, so
that it possesses considerable dramatic interest.</p>
<p>After a short instrumental introduction the cantata
opens with a double chorus in antiphonal style,
in which both the bright and the dark sides of
winter are celebrated. The second choir takes up
the theme:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The trees lift up their branches bare</p>
<p class="t">Against the sky:</p>
<p class="t0">Through the keen and nipping air</p>
<p class="t">For spring&rsquo;s return they seem to cry,</p>
<p class="t0">As the winds with solemn tone</p>
<p class="t0">About them sadly moan;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_229">[229]</div>
<p>and the first choir replies:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Old Winter&rsquo;s hand is always free,</p>
<p class="t">He scatters diamonds round;</p>
<p class="t0">They dart their light from every tree,</p>
<p class="t">They glisten on the ground.</p>
<p class="t0">Then who shall call the branches bare,</p>
<p class="t0">When gems like those are sparkling there?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The two then join and bring their friendly contest
to a close:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">2nd Choir.&mdash;&ldquo;Come in, and closely shut the door</p>
<p class="t7">Against the wintry weather;</p>
<p class="t6">Of frost and snow we&rsquo;ll think no more,</p>
<p class="t7">While round the fire we sit together.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">1st Choir.&mdash;&ldquo;Rush out from every cottage door,</p>
<p class="t7">&rsquo;Tis brave and bracing weather;</p>
<p class="t6">A madder throng ne&rsquo;er met before,</p>
<p class="t7">Than those which now have come together.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This double number, which is very effective, is followed
by a soprano recitative and romance (&ldquo;Welcome,
blest Season&rdquo;), tender and yet joyous in
character, which celebrates the delight of friendly
reunions at Christmas tide, and the pleasure with
which those long absent seek &ldquo;the old familiar
door.&rdquo; In the next number, an old English carol
(&ldquo;A Blessing on this noble House and all who in it
dwell&rdquo;), Christmas is fairly introduced. It is sung
first in unison by full chorus, then changes to harmony,
in which one choir retains the melody, and
closes with a new subject for orchestral treatment,
the united choirs singing the carol. Christmas
would not be complete without its story; and this
<span class="pb" id="pg_230">[230]</span>
we have in the next number for contralto solo and
chorus, entitled &ldquo;A Christmas Tale.&rdquo; It is preceded
by recitative, written in the old English style,
and each verse closes with a refrain, first sung as
a solo, and then repeated in full harmony by the
chorus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A bleak and kindless morning had broke on Althenay,</p>
<p class="t0">Where shunning Danish foemen the good King Alfred lay;</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;In search of food our hunters departed long ago,</p>
<p class="t0">I fear that they have perished, embedded in the snow.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">While thus he sadly muses, an aged man he sees,</p>
<p class="t0">With white hair on his forehead like frost upon the trees.</p>
<p class="t0">An image of the winter the haggard pilgrim stands,</p>
<p class="t0">And breathing forth his sorrows, lifts up his withered hands:</p>
<p class="t4">&lsquo;The Heavenly King, who reigns on high,</p>
<p class="t4">Bless him who hears the poor man&rsquo;s cry.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Our hearts are moved with pity, thy sufferings we deplore,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Said Alfred&rsquo;s queen, the gentle, &lsquo;but scanty is our store;</p>
<p class="t0">One loaf alone is left us.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then give it,&rsquo; said the King,</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;For He who feeds the ravens, yes, He will fresh abundance bring.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">The wind was roaring loudly, the snow was falling fast,</p>
<p class="t0">As from the lofty turret the last, last loaf he cast.</p>
<p class="t0">An image of the winter, the haggard pilgrim stands,</p>
<p class="t0">And Alfred&rsquo;s welcome pittance he catches with his hands.</p>
<p class="t4">&lsquo;The Heavenly King, who reigns on high,</p>
<p class="t4">Bless him who hears the poor man&rsquo;s cry.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The snow is thickly falling, the winter wind is loud,</p>
<p class="t0">But yonder in the distance appears a joyous crowd.</p>
<p class="t0">The hunters bring their booty, the peasants bring their corn,</p>
<p class="t0">And cheering songs of triumph along the blast are borne.</p>
<p class="t0">Before another morning down-stricken is the foe,</p>
<p class="t0">And blood of Danish warriors is red upon the snow.</p>
<p class="t0">Amid the conquering Saxons the aged pilgrim stands,</p>
<p class="t0">And like a holy prophet exclaims with lifted hands,</p>
<p class="t4">&lsquo;The Heavenly King, who reigns on high,</p>
<p class="t4">Bless him who hears the poor man&rsquo;s cry.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_231">[231]</div>
<p>A graceful little duet for female voices (&ldquo;Little
Children, all rejoice&rdquo;), picturing the delights of
childhood and its exemption from care, follows the
Saxon story and leads up to the finale, which is
choral throughout, and gives all the pleasant details
of Christmas cheer,&mdash;the feast in the vaulted hall,
the baron of beef, the boar with the lemon in his
jaw, the pudding, &ldquo;gem of all the feast,&rdquo; the generous
wassail, and the mistletoe bough with its warning
to maids. In delightfully picturesque old English
music the joyous scene comes to an end:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">

<p class="t0">And when they fail how merry is the shout!</p>
<p class="t">Round yon flickering flame of blue</p>

<h3>MACKENZIE.</h3>
<p>Alexander C. Mackenzie, one of
the very few successful Scotch composers,
was born at Edinburgh, in 1847. His
father was a musician, and recognizing
his son&rsquo;s talent, sent him to Germany at the age
of ten. He began his studies with Ulrich Eduard
Stein at Schwartzburg-Sondershausen, and four years
later entered the ducal orchestra as violinist. He
remained there until 1862, when he went to England
to study the violin with M. Sainton. In the
same year he was elected king&rsquo;s scholar of the
Royal Academy of Music. Three years later he returned
to Edinburgh and established himself as a
piano-teacher. The main work of his life, however,
has been composition, and to this he has devoted
himself with assiduity and remarkable success.
Grove catalogues among his works: &ldquo;Cervantes,&rdquo;
an overture for orchestra; a scherzo, for ditto;
overture to a comedy; a string quintet, and many
other pieces in MS.; piano-forte quartet in B., op.
11; Trois Morceaux pour Piano, op. 15; two songs,
op. 12; besides songs, part-songs, anthems, and
<span class="pb" id="pg_233">[233]</span>
pieces for the piano. This catalogue can now be
increased by four of the most important works he
has produced: a Scotch Rhapsody, introduced into
this country by the Theodore Thomas orchestra;
the oratorio &ldquo;Rose of Sharon&rdquo; (1884); an opera,
&ldquo;The Troubadour&rdquo; (1885), and the cantata, &ldquo;The
Story of Sayid&rdquo; (1886), which forms the subject of
the subjoined sketch.</p>
</div>
<div id="c073" title="The Story of Sayid">
<h4>The Story of Sayid.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Story of Sayid,&rdquo; a dramatic cantata in two
parts, the libretto by Joseph Bennett, was first produced
at the Leeds Triennial Festival, Oct. 13, 1886.
Its story is founded upon that of a poem in Edwin
Arnold&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pearls of the Faith,&rdquo; and embodies a
myth which is current among nearly all Oriental
nations. The characters are Ilmas, daughter of
S&acirc;wa (soprano); Sayid, an Arab chief (tenor);
S&acirc;wa, a Hindoo prince (barytone); a watchman
(tenor or barytone); and a horseman (barytone).
The opening scene pictures the desolation of the
land of S&acirc;wa, caused by the invasion of an Arab
band, led by their chieftain, Sayid. In the midst of
the popular lamentations a messenger announces
the defeat of the Arabs and the capture of their
leader, who is brought to the city and sentenced
to death on the spot. As Sayid prepares to meet
his fate, he is recognized by S&acirc;wa as his rescuer at a
time when he was hunting in the hills and perishing
<span class="pb" id="pg_234">[234]</span>
with thirst. He offers him any boon he may ask
except that of life. Sayid entreats that he may
be allowed to visit his aged father, promising to return
afterwards and suffer his fate. When S&acirc;wa
asks who will be hostage for him, his own daughter,
Ilmas, offers herself. Moved to pity for the Arab,
she persists in her offer, and her father at last reluctantly
consents. The second scene opens in
Ilmas&rsquo;s palace, and we discover that pity has grown
into passion for Sayid during his absence. She is
interrupted in her meditations by S&acirc;wa, who enters
with his counsellors, and announces that lightnings
have flashed from the altars of Siva, and that the
gods have demanded that the hostage must suffer in
the absence of Sayid. Ilmas bids her attendants
array her in bridal robes, and in the next scene
appears in an open space near the city gate, surrounded
by the court retinue and soldiers, and accompanied
by her maidens, strewing flowers in her
path. Ilmas is led to the centre of the space and
kneels down, the executioner standing over her and
awaiting the signal to be given by the watchman
when the sun sets. Before that time comes the
latter excitedly announces the rapid approach of an
Arab horseman. While the crowd stand eagerly
waiting his arrival, Sayid gallops through the gateway
and presents himself to the Prince. He then turns
to Ilmas, who warmly receives him, and affirms that
whatever fate may overtake him she shall always
cherish his memory. S&acirc;wa relents, bids the Arab
live and be his friend, and we infer the happiness
<span class="pb" id="pg_235">[235]</span>
of the lovers from the invocation of &ldquo;Love the
Conqueror,&rdquo; which brings the Damon and Pythias
story, to a close.</p>
<p>A very brief orchestral prelude introduces the
opening chorus with solos:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Alas! our land is desolate,</p>
<p class="t">The children cry for bread;</p>
<p class="t0">Around, fierce fire and sword devour,</p>
<p class="t">Our women wail their dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We pray for vengeance on the foe,</p>
<p class="t">To death consign them all;</p>
<p class="t0">Siva, arise and fight for us,</p>
<p class="t">Or see thine altars fall.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As the expressive chorus comes to a close, an allegro
movement leads to a dialogue between the people
and the watchman, and subsequently with the horseman,
who announces the approach of the victorious
army, followed by a second chorus of the people
invoking Siva (&ldquo;Vishnu, Vishnu, thou hast heard
our Cry!&rdquo;). The scene is very dramatic throughout,
and is accompanied by vigorous and suggestive
music. The next number is a triumphal march,
remarkable for its local color, and gradually increasing
in power and effect as the army approaches the
city. It is followed by an excited dialogue between
S&acirc;wa and Sayid, with choral responses, and leads up
to a beautiful melody for Sayid:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Where sets the sun adown the crimson west</p>
<p class="t">My native valley lies;</p>
<p class="t0">There by a gentle stream that murmurs rest</p>
<p class="t">My father&rsquo;s tents arise.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_236">[236]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Fearing no harm, the happy peasant tills,</p>
<p class="t">The woolly flocks increase;</p>
<p class="t0">The shepherd&rsquo;s pipe is heard upon the hills,</p>
<p class="t">And all around is peace.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another dramatic scene follows, in which S&acirc;wa
consents to Sayid&rsquo;s return to his father, and accepts
Ilmas as his bondswoman, which leads to a very
spirited and elaborate melody for the latter (&ldquo;First
of his Prophet&rsquo;s Warriors he&rdquo;). The first part closes
with the departure of Sayid and a repetition of the
choral invocation of Siva.</p>
<p>The second part opens in an apartment of S&acirc;wa&rsquo;s
palace, and discloses Ilmas sitting with her maidens,
as a thunderstorm dies away in the distance. The
latter join in a graceful chorus, which is one of the
most beautiful numbers in the cantata:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Sweet the balmy days of spring,</p>
<p class="t0">And blushing roses that they bring;</p>
<p class="t3">But sweeter far is love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Ilmas answers them in a broad and exultant
strain (&ldquo;Ay, sweet indeed is Love&rdquo;). As the song
ends, S&acirc;wa and attendants enter, and the scene
closes with a very dramatic chorus and solos, accompanying
the preparations for death. The second
scene opens with a solemn march for orchestra, preparing
the way for the climax, and leading up to a
chorus and solo for Ilmas (&ldquo;What have these Sounds
to do with bridal Robes?&rdquo;). As she kneels, awaiting
her fate, an orchestral interlude, set to the rhythm
of the gallop, indicates the rapid approach of Sayid.
A short and agitated dialogue follows between the
<span class="pb" id="pg_237">[237]</span>
watchman and the people. Sayid declares his presence,
and a graceful duet with Ilmas ensues (&ldquo;Noble
Maiden, low before thee Sayid bows&rdquo;), leading to a
powerful choral finale (&ldquo;Never before was known
a Deed like this&rdquo;), closing with a stirring outburst
for all the voices:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;O Love, thy car triumphal</p>
<p class="t0">Rolls round the subject world</p>
<p class="t0">More glorious than the chariot</p>
<p class="t6">Of the sun.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;We hail thee, Love victorious!</p>

<div id="c074" title="Jubilee Ode">
<h4>Jubilee Ode.<sup><a id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></sup></h4>
<p>This work, upon which Dr. Mackenzie has been
engaged for some time past, is now complete, and
on its way to several distant parts of the Empire,
where arrangements are making to perform it in
celebration of the Jubilee. Primarily, as our readers
know, the Ode was intended for the Crystal Palace
only, but it will be given also in Canada, Australia,
<span class="pb" id="pg_238">[238]</span>
Trinidad, Cape Colony, etc.; thus standing out
from all its fellows as in some sort an Imperial
work.</p>
<p>Without anticipating the criticism which will follow
upon performance, we may here give some idea
of the scope and character of the Ode. Mr. Joseph
Bennett, the writer of the words, has kept strictly in
view the exigencies of a musical setting. He has
obviously prepared, not a short poem for readers,
but one for musical hearers. Hence a variety of
rhythm and structure which otherwise would certainly
not have been ventured upon. From the
same cause arises also the manner in which the subject
is laid out, with a view to contrast of musical
effect. We may indicate the nature of this arrangement.
In the first vocal number, a chorus, the
news of the Jubilee is proclaimed, and its diffusion
throughout the Empire called for. The second
number, a tenor solo, conveys to the Queen the
affectionate greetings of her home-lands, declaring
that, to keep the feast with unanimity, all weapons
of party warfare are laid aside. In the third number
the Colonies and Dependencies pay their homage,
the idea worked out being that of a procession
passing before the throne. First comes the Dominion,
followed by Australia, the smaller colonies
and islands, and, lastly, by India. Each of these
divisions has a section of the chorus to itself. The
fifth number, a soprano solo, dwells upon the personal
virtues of the Sovereign; while the sixth, and
last, opening with a choral prayer for the Empire,
<span class="pb" id="pg_239">[239]</span>
continues with lines leading to the National Anthem,
for which a new second verse has been written. How
far the writer has been guided by consideration for
musical opportunities need not, after this outline
sketch, be indicated. The spirit in which Mr.
Bennett has approached his theme best appears,
perhaps, in the opening verses:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t4">&ldquo;For fifty years our Queen!</p>
<p class="t12">Victoria! hail!</p>
<p class="t4">Take up the cry, glad voices,</p>
<p class="t5">And pass the strain</p>
<p class="t5">O&rsquo;er hill and plain,</p>
<p class="t0">Peaceful hamlet, roaring city, flowing river,</p>
<p class="t4">Till all the land rejoices.</p>
<p class="t0">Wild clanging bells and thund&rsquo;rous cannon</p>
<p class="t0">With your loudest shock the air, and make it quiver</p>
<p class="t0">From Dee to Tamar, Thames to Shannon.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t4">&ldquo;For fifty years our Queen!</p>
<p class="t12">Victoria! hail!</p>
<p class="t4">Take up the cry, old ocean,</p>
<p class="t5">And hoarsely shout</p>
<p class="t5">The words about.</p>
<p class="t0">British ships and world-wide British lands will cheer them,</p>
<p class="t4">Rouse an Empire&rsquo;s full devotion.</p>
<p class="t0">O blowing wind, come hither, bearing</p>
<p class="t0">Answering voices, loud acclaiming. Hark! we hear them.</p>
<p class="t0">They our loyal pride are sharing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In setting the words to music, Dr. Mackenzie has
necessarily to consider the place of performance
and the number of performers. This, however, was
an amiable and fortunate obligation, since the result
has been to give us a work built upon broad lines,
and marked by plainness of structure to an extent
<span class="pb" id="pg_240">[240]</span>
unusual with the composer. We think that the
music will be found to have a true festive ring, and
a majestic solidity befitting the occasion. In the
solos, with their more subdued expression, Dr. Mackenzie
has kept contrast in view, without sacrifice
of simplicity; but it is in the choruses that he best
shows himself a master of bold and striking effects.
Every bar goes straight to the point, while avoiding
the commonplaces that naturally suggest themselves
in the writing of festive music. The procession
chorus is, in this respect, most noteworthy of all,
and may be found no mean rival of that in the
&ldquo;Rose of Sharon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="fnblock">
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_29" href="#fr_29">[29]</a></sup> As the score of Mr. Mackenzie&rsquo;s Ode has not yet reached
this country, the author has taken the liberty of transferring the
above analysis of it to his work from the London &ldquo;Musical Times&rdquo;
for May, 1887. Although its local character may preclude its
performance here, it is not improbable that the composition of
a composer so eminent will attract attention among American
musicians.

<h3>MASSENET.</h3>
<p>Jules &Eacute;mile Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Massenet,
a composer as yet but little known in this
country, was born at Montaud, France,
May 12, 1842. His musical education
was obtained in the Paris Conservatory, in which
between the years 1859 and 1863 he carried off
two first prizes and one second. After leaving the
Conservatory, he went to Italy for a time and pursued
his studies in composition. On his return to
Paris one of his operas, &ldquo;La Grand Tante,&rdquo; was
produced at the Op&eacute;ra Comique (1867) through
the influence of Ambroise Thomas, and this performance
called attention to the works of the rising
young musician. In 1872 he brought out &ldquo;Don
C&aelig;sar de Bazan,&rdquo; an op&eacute;ra comique in three acts,
and in the following year incidental music to the
tragedy &ldquo;Les Erinnyes,&rdquo; after &AElig;schylus. Among
his works written since that time are &ldquo;Le Roi de
Lahore&rdquo; (1877); &ldquo;Herodiade&rdquo; (1882); &ldquo;Manon&rdquo;
(1885); &ldquo;Le Cid&rdquo; (1885); the cantata &ldquo;Paix et
Libert&eacute;&rdquo; (1867); &ldquo;Marie Magdaleine&rdquo; (1873);
&ldquo;Eve,&rdquo; a mystery (1875); &ldquo;La Vierge,&rdquo; sacred
legend; and &ldquo;Narcisse,&rdquo; antique idylle (1878).
<span class="pb" id="pg_242">[242]</span>
Among his orchestral works the best known are
&ldquo;Suites d&rsquo;orchestre;&rdquo; &ldquo;Scenes Hongroises;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Scenes Pittoresques;&rdquo; &ldquo;Scenes Dramatiques;&rdquo;
overture &ldquo;Ph&egrave;dre;&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pompeia,&rdquo; fantasia-symphony.
He has also written numerous songs
and piano-forte pieces. His operas thus far have
been his most successful works, though several of his
large concert pieces have been very favorably received.
He now occupies a position in the Paris
Conservatory, and is regarded as one of the most
promising members of the modern French school.</p>
</div>
<div id="c076" title="Mary Magdalen">
<h4>Mary Magdalen.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Magdalen&rdquo; was written in 1873, and was
first performed at the Od&eacute;on, Paris, in that year,
with Mmes. Viardot and Vidal and MM. Bosquin
and Petit in the solo parts. It is styled by its composer
a sacred drama, and is divided into three acts,
the first entitled &ldquo;The Magdalen at the Fountain;&rdquo;
the second, &ldquo;Jesus before the Magdalen;&rdquo; the third,
&ldquo;Golgotha,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Magdalen at the Cross,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Tomb of Jesus and the Resurrection;&rdquo; the
first two scenes in the last act being included in one
tableau, and the third in another. The characters
represented are Mary Magdalen, Martha, Jesus, and
Judas, the chorus parts being assigned to the Disciples,
Pharisees, Scribes, publicans, soldiers, servants,
holy women, and people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_243">[243]</div>
<p>After a short introduction, pastoral in character,
the work begins with a scene representing Mary at
the fountain of Magdala near sunset, among women,
publicans, Scribes, and Pharisees, strolling along the
banks of the little stream that flows from it. The
women sing a short chorus full of Oriental color anticipating
the approach of the beautiful Nazarene.
A group of young Magdalens pass along singing
blithely of love and gay cavaliers (&ldquo;C&rsquo;est l&rsquo;heure
o&ugrave; conduisant de longues Caravanes&rdquo;), and the
song of the women blends with it. Next follows
a chorus of the Scribes, discussing this Stranger,
and pronouncing Him an impostor, and again the
young Magdalens take up their strain. The second
number is a pathetic aria by Mary (&ldquo;O mes S&oelig;urs&rdquo;),
which is full of tender beauty. The women shrink
back from her and join in a taunting chorus (&ldquo;La
belle P&eacute;cheresse oublie&rdquo;). Next, Judas appears upon
the scene, and servilely saluting Mary counsels her to
abandon sadness and return to love, in an aria which
is a good illustration of irony in music. It is followed
by a powerful and mocking chorus of women,
Pharisees, and Scribes (&ldquo;Vainement tu pleures&rdquo;),
in which she is taunted with her shame, despite her
sad appeals for pity. The next scene is an aria and
trio. Jesus appears in their midst, and in a calm
impressive aria (&ldquo;Vous qui fl&eacute;trissez les Erreurs des
autres&rdquo;) rebukes them. Mary prostrates herself at
His feet and implores pardon, and the scene closes
with a trio for Jesus, Mary, and Judas, leading up
to a strong concerted finale closing the act, in which
<span class="pb" id="pg_244">[244]</span>
Jesus bids the Magdalen rise and return to her
home, whither He is about to repair.</p>
<p>The second act opens in the Magdalen&rsquo;s house,
which is richly decorated with flowers and redolent
with perfume. It begins with a sensuous female
chorus (&ldquo;Le Seuil est par&eacute; de Fleurs rares&rdquo;) followed
by Martha&rsquo;s admonition to the servants that
He who is more powerful than earthly kings cares
not for vain shows. The chorus resumes its song,
and at its close Judas appears and a long dialogue
follows in which Martha rebukes his hypocrisy.
As he departs, Mary and Martha in a very graceful
duet discourse of the Saviour&rsquo;s coming, which is interrupted
by His presence and invocation of blessing.
After a duet between Jesus and Mary, in
which He commends her to the Good Shepherd,
the act closes with a powerful and very dramatic
finale containing Jesus&rsquo; rebuke to Judas and His
declaration of the coming betrayal, after which the
Disciples join in a simple but very effective prayer
(&ldquo;Notre P&egrave;re, lou&eacute; soit Nom radieux&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The third act is divided into two tableaux. In
the first we have the scene of the crucifixion, the
agitated choruses of the groups about the Cross,
the mocking strains of the Pharisees bidding Him
descend if He is the Master, the sorrowing song of
Mary (&ldquo;O Bien-aim&eacute; sous la sombre Couronne&rdquo;),
and the final tragedy. The second is devoted to
the resurrection and apparition, which are treated
very dramatically, closing with an exultant Easter
hymn (&ldquo;Christ est vivant, ressuscit&eacute;&rdquo;).</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_245">[245]</div>
<p>In the first two acts the music is full of rich
Oriental color and is gracefully melodious and well
adapted to the situation; but in the last act the awful
solemnity of the tragedy is somewhat lost in the
theatrical manner of its treatment. Indeed it was
hardly necessary that the composer should have
disclaimed the title of oratorio which some have
assigned to the work. His division of it into acts
and tableaux was sufficient to indicate that he had
the stage in mind when he was writing; or at least
that his scheme was operatic in style.</p>

<h3>MENDELSSOHN.</h3>
<p>Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy,
the son of a Berlin banker, was born
at Hamburg, Feb. 3, 1809, and, unlike
almost all other composers, was reared
in the lap of luxury. He enjoyed every advantage
which wealth could procure, with the result that he
became highly educated in the other arts as well as
in music. His teachers in music were Zelter and
Ludwig Berger, and he made such progress that in
his ninth year he appeared in public as a pianist
in Berlin and afterwards in Paris. The first of his
compositions to attract general notice were the
overture to Shakspeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream&rdquo; and the little opera &ldquo;The Marriage of
Camacho,&rdquo; which were brought out in Berlin in
1827. After several concert-tours, in which he met
with great success, he resided for some time in
D&uuml;sseldorf. In 1835 he went to Leipsic as director
of the famous Gewandhaus concerts,&mdash;which are
still given in that city. Two years later he married
C&eacute;cile Jeanrenaud, the beautiful daughter of a minister
of the Reformed Church in Frankfort, and
<span class="pb" id="pg_247">[247]</span>
shortly afterwards went to Berlin as general director
of church music. In 1843 he returned to his former
post in Leipsic, and also took a position in the
newly established Conservatory, where he spent the
remainder of his days in company with his family,
to whom he was closely attached. He has left a
large and rich collection of musical works, which
are favorites the world over. His three great
oratorios are the &ldquo;Hymn of Praise,&rdquo; catalogued as
a symphony-cantata, &ldquo;St. Paul,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Elijah.&rdquo;
Besides these oratorios, the exquisite music to the
&ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream,&rdquo; which is familiar the
world over, and his stately dramatic music to &ldquo;Antigone,&rdquo;
he has left five symphonies, of which the
&ldquo;Scotch,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Italian,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Reformation&rdquo;
are best known; four beautiful overtures, &ldquo;Ruy
Blas,&rdquo; &ldquo;Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hebrides,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Melusina;&rdquo; the very dramatic cantata,
&ldquo;The Walpurgis Night;&rdquo; a long list of songs for
one or more voices; the incidental music to Racine&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Athalia;&rdquo; a very large collection of sacred
music, such as psalms, hymns, anthems, and cantatas;
several trios and other specimens of chamber
music; and the lovely &ldquo;Songs without Words,&rdquo;
which are to be found upon almost every piano,
the beauty and freshness of which time has not
impaired. Mendelssohn never wrote a grand opera,
owing to his fastidiousness as to a libretto; though
he finally obtained one from Geibel on the subject
of the &ldquo;Loreley&rdquo; which suited him. He had
begun to write it, and had finished the finale to the
<span class="pb" id="pg_248">[248]</span>
first act, when death interrupted his work, Nov. 4,
1847. In addition to the subjoined compositions
selected for description, the following may be mentioned
as possessing the cantata characteristics:
op. 31, the 115th Psalm, for solo, chorus, and orchestra;
op. 46, the 95th Psalm, for chorus and
orchestra; op. 51, the 114th Psalm, for double
chorus and orchestra; op. 78, three Psalms for solo
and chorus; op. 91, the 98th Psalm, for double
chorus and orchestra; and op. 96, Hymn (&ldquo;Lass,
O Herr mich&rdquo;) for alto solo, chorus, and orchestra.</p>
</div>
<div id="c078" title="The Walpurgis Night">
<h4>The Walpurgis Night.</h4>
<p>It was during his Italian travels in 1831 that
Mendelssohn composed the music to Goethe&rsquo;s
poem &ldquo;The First Walpurgis Night.&rdquo; His letters
throw much and interesting light upon the composition
and his ideas while writing it. In a letter
written at Rome, Feb. 22, 1831, he says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Listen and wonder! Since I left Vienna I have
partly composed Goethe&rsquo;s &lsquo;First Walpurgis Night,&rsquo;
but have not yet had courage to write it down. The
composition has now assumed a form and become a
grand cantata, with full orchestra, and may turn out well.
At the opening there are songs of spring, etc., and
plenty others of the same kind. Afterwards, when the
watchmen with their &lsquo;Gabeln, und Zacken, und Eulen,&rsquo;
make a great noise, the fairy frolics begin, and you
know that I have a particular foible for them; the
sacrificial Druids then appear with their trombones in
<span class="pb" id="pg_249">[249]</span>
C major, when the watchmen come in again in alarm;
and here I mean to introduce a light, mysterious,
tripping chorus, and lastly to conclude with a grand
sacrificial hymn. Do you not think that this might
develop into a new style of cantata? I have an instrumental
introduction as a matter of course, and the
effect of the whole is spirited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 27th of April ensuing he refers to it
again:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I must however return to my witches, so you must
forgive my not writing any more to-day. This whole
letter seems to hover in uncertainty, or rather I do so
in my &lsquo;Walpurgis Night,&rsquo; whether I am to introduce
the big drum or not. &lsquo;Zacken, Gabeln, und wilde
Klapperst&ouml;cke&rsquo; seem to force me to the big drum,
but moderation dissuades me. I certainly am the
only person who ever composed for the scene on the
Brocken without employing a piccolo-flute, but I can&rsquo;t
help regretting the big drum; and before I can receive
Fanny&rsquo;s<sup><a id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a></sup>
advice, the &lsquo;Walpurgis Night&rsquo; will be finished and packed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his way back to Germany he writes from
Milan, July 13, 1831, to the artist and operatic
director, Eduard Devrient:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I have been writing a large composition that perhaps
will one day make some effect,&mdash;&lsquo;The First
Walpurgis Night&rsquo; of Goethe. I began it simply because
it pleased and excited me; I did not think of
any performance. But now that it is finished, I see
that it is well suited for a large concert piece, and in
<span class="pb" id="pg_250">[250]</span>
my first subscription concert in Berlin you shall sing
the bearded Druid,&mdash;the chorus sung by &mdash;&mdash;, kindly
assisted by &mdash;&mdash;. I have written the part of the Druid
into your throstle (by permission), and you will have to
sing it out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was several years before the &ldquo;Walpurgis Night&rdquo;
was publicly performed, and meanwhile it underwent
several changes. On the 28th of November,
1842, he writes to his mother:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I am really anxious to make the &lsquo;Walpurgis Night&rsquo;
into a symphony-cantata, for which it was originally
intended, but did not become so from want of courage
on my part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 11th of December of the same year he
writes her:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;My &lsquo;Walpurgis Night&rsquo; is to appear once more in
the second part, in a somewhat different garb indeed
from the former one, which was somewhat too richly
endowed with trombones, and rather poor in the vocal
parts; but to effect this I have been obliged to re-write
the whole score from A to Z, and to add two
new arias, not to mention the rest of the clipping and
cutting. If I don&rsquo;t like it now, I solemnly vow to
give it up for the rest of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cantata was first publicly performed in Leipsic,
Feb. 2, 1843, at a concert, in which it occupied
the second part of the programme. It had to stand
a severe test of comparison, for the first part was
very brilliant, including a Haydn symphony, a Mozart
aria, Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Choral Fantasie,&rdquo; the piano
<span class="pb" id="pg_251">[251]</span>
part played by Madame Schumann, the overture
from &ldquo;Euryanthe,&rdquo; and the chorus from Weber&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Lyre and Sword;&rdquo; but it made a success, and was
received with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The subject of the cantata is a very simple one.
The witches of the Northern mythology were supposed
to hold their revels on the summit of the
Brocken on the eve of the 1st of May (Walpurgis
Night), and the details of their wild and infernal
&ldquo;Sabbath&rdquo; are familiar to every reader of &ldquo;Faust.&rdquo;
In his separate poem Goethe seeks to go back to
the origin of the first Walpurgis Night. May-day
eve was consecrated to Saint Walpurgis, who converted
the Saxons from Druidism to Christianity, and
on that night the evil spirits were said to be abroad.
Goethe conceived the idea that the Druids on that
night betook themselves to the mountains to celebrate
their rites without interference from the Christians,
accomplishing their purpose by disguising
their sentinels as demons, who, when the Christians
approached, ran through the woods with torches,
clashed their arms, uttered hideous noises, and thus
frightened them away, leaving the Druids free to
finish their sacrifices.</p>
<p>The cantata begins with an overture in two movements,
an <i>allegro con fuoco</i> and an <i>allegro vivace</i>,
which describes in vivid tone-colors the passing of
the season from winter to spring. The first number
is a tenor solo and chorus of Druids, which are full
of spring feeling, rising to religious fervor in the
close:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_252">[252]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;Now May again</p>
<p class="t2">Breaks winter&rsquo;s chain,</p>
<p class="t0">The buds and bloom are springing;</p>
<p class="t2">No snow is seen,</p>
<p class="t2">The vales are green,</p>
<p class="t0">The woodland choirs are singing!</p>
<p class="t2">Yon mountain height</p>
<p class="t2">Is wintry white;</p>
<p class="t0">Upon it we will gather,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t2">Begin the ancient holy rite;</p>
<p class="t0">Praise our Almighty Father.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The next number is an alto solo, the warning of
an aged woman of the people, which is very dramatic
in its style:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Know ye not a deed so daring</p>
<p class="t0">Dooms us all to die despairing?</p>
<p class="t0">Know ye not it is forbidden</p>
<p class="t0">By the edicts of our foemen?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The warning is followed by a stately exhortation
from the Druid priest (&ldquo;The man who flies our
sacrifice&rdquo;), leading up to a short chorus of a very
stirring character in which the Druids resolve to
go on with their rites. It is followed by a pianissimo
chorus of the guards whispering to each other
to &ldquo;secure the passes round the glen.&rdquo; One of them
suggests the demon scheme for frightening the
enemy, which leads to the chorus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Come with torches brightly flashing;</p>
<p class="t0">Rush along with billets clashing;</p>
<p class="t0">Through the night-gloom lead and follow,</p>
<p class="t0">In and out each rocky hollow.</p>
<p class="t2">Owls and ravens,</p>
<p class="t0">Howl with us and scare the cravens.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_253">[253]</div>
<p>In this chorus the composer has given the freest
rein to his fancy, and presents the weird scene in a
grotesque chaos of musical effects, both vocal and
instrumental, which may fairly be called infernal,
and yet preserves form and rhythm throughout.
It is followed by an exalted and impressive hymn
for bass solo and chorus, which is a relief after the
diablerie of the preceding number:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">&ldquo;Restrained by might</p>
<p class="t2">We now by night</p>
<p class="t0">In secret here adore Thee.</p>
<p class="t2">Still it is day</p>
<p class="t2">Whene&rsquo;er we pray,</p>
<p class="t0">And humbly bow before Thee.</p>
<p class="t2">Thou canst assuage</p>
<p class="t2">Our foemen&rsquo;s rage</p>
<p class="t0">And shield us from their terrors.</p>
<p class="t2">The flame aspires!</p>
<p class="t2">The smoke retires!</p>
<p class="t0">Thus clear our faith from errors!</p>
<p class="t2">Our customs quelled,</p>
<p class="t2">Our rights withheld,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy light shall shine forever.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Following this impressive hymn comes the terrified
warning of the Christian guard (tenor) and the
response of his equally terrified comrades:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Help, my comrades! see a legion</p>
<p class="t0">Yonder comes from Satan&rsquo;s region!</p>

<p class="t">To and fro in flames advancing;</p>
<p class="t0">Some on wolves and dragons riding,</p>
<p class="t">See, ah, see them hither prancing!</p>
<p class="t0">What a clattering troop of evil!</p>
<p class="t0">Let us, let us quickly fly them!</p>

<p>As the Christians disappear, scared by the demon
<i>ruse</i>, the Druids once more, led by their priest,
resume their rites, closing with another choral
hymn of praise similar in style to the first.</p>

<div id="c079" title="Antigone">
<h4>Antigone.</h4>
<p>Mendelssohn wrote incidental music to four great
dramas,&mdash;the &ldquo;Antigone&rdquo; of Sophocles (1841);
the &ldquo;&OElig;dipus at Colonos&rdquo; of Sophocles (1843);
the &ldquo;Athalia&rdquo; of Racine (1843); and the &ldquo;Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; of Shakspeare (1843), the
overture to which was written by him in 1826. The
latter is mainly instrumental. Of the other three,
the music to &ldquo;Antigone&rdquo; and &ldquo;&OElig;dipus&rdquo; is most
frequently performed, and for that reason has been
selected for description.</p>
<p>In June, 1841, the King of Saxony invited Mendelssohn
to become his Capellmeister. Frederick
William IV. of Prussia had made him a similar
offer about the same time. He accepted the latter
and removed to Berlin, and the first duty imposed
upon him by the King was the composition of music
to the &ldquo;Antigone&rdquo; of Sophocles. With the
assistance of the poet Tieck, who helped arrange
the text, the work was accomplished in the short
space of eleven days, and was given on the Potsdam
<span class="pb" id="pg_255">[255]</span>
Court stage October 28, to a private audience. It
was first performed in public at Leipsic, March 5,
1842. It is written for male chorus and orchestra,
and includes seven numbers; namely, 1. Introduction
and maestoso (&ldquo;Strahl des Helios sch&ouml;nstes
Licht&rdquo;); 2. Andante con moto (&ldquo;Vieles Gewaltige
lebt&rdquo;); 3. Moderato (&ldquo;Ihr Seligen deren&rdquo;); 4.
Adagio (&ldquo;O Eros, Allsieger im Kampf&rdquo;); 5. Recitative
and chorus (&ldquo;Noch toset des Sturmes Gewalt&rdquo;);
6. Allegro maestoso (&ldquo;Vielnamiger! Wonn&rsquo;
und Stolz&rdquo;); 7. Andante alla marcia (&ldquo;Hier
Kommt er ja selbst&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The following extracts will give a comprehensive
view of this powerful and felicitous music. Lampadius,
writing of the first public performance,
says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;On the 5th of March the &lsquo;Antigone&rsquo; of Sophocles,
translated by Donner and set to music by Mendelssohn,
was brought out at the Leipsic theatre before a full
audience. The composer directed, and was received
with great applause. The music indeed was not antique,
if to be so it must be played on the
<span title="syrinx" class="g">&sigma;&#8059;&rho;&iota;&gamma;&xi;</span>, the
<span title="salpinx" class="g">&sigma;&#8049;&lambda;&pi;&iota;&gamma;&xi;</span>, and the
<span title="phorminx" class="g">&phi;&#8057;&rho;&mu;&iota;&gamma;&xi;</span>, or if the composer must confine
himself to that Greek type of melody and harmony
of which all we know is that it was extremely simple,
and, according to our ideas, meagre; but it was antique
completely, in its being filled with the fire of the
tragedy and making its spirit intelligible to us moderns,
strengthening the meaning of the words, and
giving a running musical commentary on them....
With us at Leipsic, as indeed everywhere, the Eros
Chorus, with its solemn awe in the presence of the
<span class="pb" id="pg_256">[256]</span>
divine omnipotence of love, and the Bacchus Chorus,
which, swinging the thyrsus, celebrates the praise of
the Theban maiden&rsquo;s son in joyous strains, as well as
the melodramatic passages, where Antigone enters,
wailing, the chamber where her dead lover lay, and
whither Creon has borne in his son&rsquo;s corpse, had an
imposing effect. The impression of the whole piece,
taken by itself, was very powerful. With amazement
our modern world realized the sublimity of the ancient
tragic muse, and recognized the &lsquo;great, gigantic fate
which exalts man while grinding him to powder.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Devrient, the director of the opera at Carlsruhe,
in his &ldquo;Recollections of Mendelssohn,&rdquo; has left a
delightful sketch of the composition of the work.
He says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Felix did not enter upon his task without the fullest
consideration. The first suggestion was to set the
chorus in unison throughout, and to recitative interspersed
with solos; and as nearly as possible to intone
or recite the words, with accompaniment of such instruments
only as may be supposed in character with
the time of Sophocles,&mdash;flutes, tubas, and harps, in the
absence of lyres. I opposed to this plan that the voice
parts would be intolerably monotonous, without the
compensatory clearness of the text being attained....</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Nevertheless Felix made the attempt to carry out
this view, but after a few days he confessed to me that
it was impracticable; that I was right in maintaining
the impossibility of making the words clear in choral
singing, except in a few places that are obviously suited
for recitative;<sup><a id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></sup>
that the chanting of a chorus would
<span class="pb" id="pg_257">[257]</span>
be vexatiously monotonous, tedious, and unmusical;
and that accompaniments for so few instruments would
give so little scope for variety of expression that it
would make the whole appear as a mere puerile imitation
of the ancient music, about which, after all, we
knew nothing. He concluded therefore that the
choruses must be sung, as the parts must be recited,
not to assimilate themselves with the usages of Attic
tragedy (which might easily lead us into absurdity)
but as we would now express ourselves in speech and
song.... With this I fully concurred; and Felix set,
so vigorously to work, that in a few weeks he played
me sketches, and by the end of September nearly the
whole chain of choruses was completed. Besides my
delight at the beauty of these choruses, they confirmed
me in the certainty that Felix&rsquo;s genius was eminently
dramatic. They not only gave the key to every scene,
the expression to each separate verse, from the narrow
complacency of the Theban citizens to their heartful
and exalted sympathy, but also a dramatic accent
soaring far beyond the words of the poet. I allude
particularly to the dithyrambus that occurs between
Creon&rsquo;s attempt to rescue Antigone and the relation
of its terrible failure. This song of praise really consists
entirely of glorifying appeals to Bacchus, and its
dramatic application lies only in the verse:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;She was its pride,</p>
<p class="t0">Who, clasping the Thunderer, died;</p>
<p class="t0">And now, seeking its lost repose,</p>
<p class="t0">We pray thee to come and heal its woes.</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, hither bend;</p>
<p class="t0">From thy Parnassian heights descend.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;To raise this chorus to be the terrible turning-point
of the action; to bring here to its culmination the
<span class="pb" id="pg_258">[258]</span>
tension excited by the awful impending doom; to give
this continually gathering power to the invocation,
&lsquo;Hear us, Bacchus!&rsquo; till it becomes a cry of agony;
to give this exhaustive musical expression to the
situation, marks the composer to have a specially
dramatic gift. And this is betokened no less in the
melodramatic portions. The idea of adding rhythmical
accompaniments to spoken words may have
been suggested by a few well-set passages in the
music to &lsquo;Faust&rsquo; by Prince Radziwill. It is to be
regretted that the public is scarcely able to appreciate
how exquisitely Mendelssohn has done this, since the
representatives of Antigone and of Creon are seldom
sufficiently musical to enter completely into the composer&rsquo;s
intention; besides that in two passages of the
accompanied dialogue of Antigone the words are not
correctly set under the music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the private performance before the King and
Court, Oct. 28, 1841, the same writer says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;We had two more rehearsals on the following day,
the evening one in the presence of the King, and the
performance itself took place on the 28th, before the
Court and all the invited celebrities of art and science.
It produced a very great sensation. The deep impression
that the revival of an ancient tragedy could
produce in our theatrical life promised to become an
influence; it has purified our musical atmosphere, and
it is certain that to Mendelssohn must be ascribed
great and important merit in the cause.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Although the learned, of whom each expected the
ancient tragedy to be put upon the stage according to
his peculiar conception of it (which would of course be
totally different in every case) might find the music too
<span class="pb" id="pg_259">[259]</span>
modern, too operatic, in fact, not sufficiently philological,
it is undeniable that Mendelssohn&rsquo;s music has
made the tragedy of Sophocles accessible to the sympathies
of the general public, without in any wise
violating the spirit and aroma of the poem, but rather
lending it new life and intelligibility.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="fnblock">
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_31" href="#fr_31">[31]</a></sup> The passages, &ldquo;But see, the son of Men&oelig;tius comes,&rdquo; etc.,
and &ldquo;See, H&aelig;mon appears,&rdquo; etc., are examples.

<div id="c080" title="&OElig;dipus at Colonos">
<h4>&OElig;dipus at Colonos.</h4>
<p>The story of &ldquo;&OElig;dipus Tyrannus&rdquo; is told in this
work in connection with Professor Paine&rsquo;s composition.
The &ldquo;&OElig;dipus at Colonos,&rdquo; to which Mendelssohn
set music, is the continuation of Sophocles&rsquo;
tragedy, describing the banishment of the blind
hero, the loving care of his daughters, his arrival
at Attica, and his death in the gardens of the
Eumenides at Colonos, absolved by the fate which
had so cruelly pursued him.</p>
<p>The music to &ldquo;&OElig;dipus&rdquo; was written at the
command of the King of Prussia in 1843, and was
first produced at Potsdam, Nov. 1, 1845. It contains
a short introduction and nine choral numbers.
The first and second choruses describe the entrance
of &OElig;dipus and Antigone into the grove of the
Eumenides, their discovery by the people, the story
of his sorrows which he relates to them, his meeting
with his daughter Ismene, and the arrival of
Theseus the King. The third number is the gem
of the work, and is often given on the concert-stage.
The free translation of the text for this beautiful
double chorus is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_260">[260]</div>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;<i>Strophe</i>.&mdash;Thou hast come, O stranger, to the
seats of this land, renowned for the steed; to seats the
fairest on earth, the chalky Colonos; where the vocal
nightingale, chief abounding, trills her plaintive note
in the green dells, tenanting the dark-hued ivy and
the leafy grove of the god, untrodden, teeming with
fruits, impervious to the sun, and unshaken by the
winds of every storm; where Bacchus, the reveller,
ever roams attending his divine nurses.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;<i>Antistrophe</i>.&mdash;And ever day by day the narcissus,
with its beauteous clusters, bursts into bloom by
heaven&rsquo;s dew, the ancient coronet of the mighty goddesses,
and the saffron with golden ray; nor do the
sleepless founts of Cephisus that wander through
the fields fail, but ever each day it rushes o&rsquo;er the
plains with its limpid wave, fertilizing the bosom of
the earth; nor have the choirs of the muses loathed
this clime; nor Venus, too, of the golden reign.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;<i>Strophe</i>.&mdash;And there is a tree, such as I hear not
to have ever sprung in the land of Asia, nor in the
mighty Doric island of Pelops, a tree unplanted by
hand, of spontaneous growth, terror of the hostile
spear, which flourishes chiefly in this region, the leaf
of the pale gray olive that nourishes our young. This
shall neither any one in youth nor in old age, marking
for destruction, and having laid it waste with his hand,
bring to nought; for the eye that never closes of
Morian Jove regards it, and the blue-eyed Minerva.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;<i>Antistrophe</i>.&mdash;And I have other praise for this
mother-city to tell, the noblest gift of the mighty
divinity, the highest vaunt, that she is the great of
chivalry, renowned for the steed and famous on the
main; for thou, O sovereign Neptune, son of Saturn,
hast raised her to this glory, having first, in these
fields, founded the bit to tame the horse; and the
<span class="pb" id="pg_261">[261]</span>
well-rowed boat, dashed forth by the hand, bounds marvellously
through the brine, tracking on the hundred-footed
daughters of Nereus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first strophe is begun by one choir in unison
after a short but graceful introduction which is repeated
at the end of the strophe in another form, and
then the second choir begins the antistrophe, set to
the same beautiful melody. At its close the music
changes in character and grows vigorous and excited
as the first choir sings the second strophe, with
which shortly the second choir joins in splendid
eight-part harmony. The latter takes up the strain
again in the second antistrophe, singing the praise
of &ldquo;the mother-city,&rdquo; and the number closes with
the united invocation to Neptune,&mdash;an effect which
has hardly been excelled in choral music. The
fourth chorus, which is very dramatic in its effect,
tells of the assault of Creon upon &OElig;dipus, and the
fifth, his protection by Theseus, who comes to the
rescue. In this number the double choirs unite
with magnificent effect in the appeal to the gods
(&ldquo;Dread Power, that fillest Heaven&rsquo;s high Throne&rdquo;)
to defend Theseus in the conflict. The sixth number
(&ldquo;When the Health and Strength are gone&rdquo;)
is a pathetic description of the blind hero&rsquo;s pitiful
condition, and prepares the way for the powerful
choruses in which his impending fate is foreshadowed
by the thunderbolts of Jove which rend the
heavens. The eighth and ninth choruses are full
of the mournful spirit of the tragedy itself, and tell
in notes as eloquent as Sophocles&rsquo; lines of the mysterious
<span class="pb" id="pg_262">[262]</span>
disappearance of the Theban hero, ingulfed
in the opening earth, and the sorrowful lamentations
of the daughters for the father whom they had
served and loved so devotedly.</p>
</div>
<div id="c081" title="As the Hart Pants">
<h4>As the Hart Pants.</h4>
<p>The music to the Forty-second Psalm, familiarly
known by the caption which forms the title of this
sketch, was first performed at the tenth subscription
Gewandhaus concert in Leipsic in 1838, Clara
Novello taking the soprano part. Though not constructed
upon the large scale of the &ldquo;Hymn of
Praise,&rdquo; or even of the &ldquo;Walpurgis Night,&rdquo; it is a
work which is thoroughly artistic, and just as complete
and symmetrical in its way. It contains seven
numbers. After a slow and well-sustained introduction,
the work begins with a chorus (&ldquo;As the
Hart pants after the Water Brooks, so panteth my
soul for Thee, O God&rdquo;) which is a veritable prayer
in its tenderness and expression of passionate longing.
After the chorus a delicate and refined soprano
solo (&ldquo;For my Soul thirsteth for God&rdquo;)
continues the sentiment, first given out in an oboe
solo, and then uttered by the voice in a beautifully
melodious adagio. The third number is a soprano
recitative (&ldquo;My Tears have been my Meat&rdquo;) leading
to a chorus in march time by the sopranos and
altos (&ldquo;For I had gone with the Multitude; I went
with them to the House of God&rdquo;). Then follows
<span class="pb" id="pg_263">[263]</span>
a full chorus beginning with male voices in unison
(&ldquo;Why, my Soul, art thou cast down?&rdquo;), answered
by the female voices (&ldquo;Trust thou in God&rdquo;).
Again the soprano voice is heard in pathetic recitative
(&ldquo;O my God! my Soul is cast down within
me; all Thy Waves and thy Billows are gone over
me&rdquo;). A beautiful quartet of male voices with string
accompaniment replies: &ldquo;The Lord will command
His Loving-kindness in the Day-time; and in
the Night His Song shall be with me, and my
Prayer unto the God of my Life.&rdquo; The response
is full of hope and consolation; but through it all
runs the mournful strain of the soprano (forming a
quintet at the end), coming to a close only when the
full chorus joins in a repetition of the fourth number
(&ldquo;Trust thou in God&rdquo;), this time elaborated
with still greater effect, and closing with a stately
ascription of praise to the God of Israel.</p>
</div>
<div id="c082" title="The Gutenberg Fest-Cantata">
<h4>The Gutenberg Fest-Cantata.</h4>
<p>The occasion for which the short festival cantata
known as the &ldquo;Gutenberg&rdquo; was written, was the
fourth centennial celebration of the art of printing,
which was observed at Leipsic in 1840 by the unveiling
of Gutenberg&rsquo;s statue in the public square,
and other ceremonies. The direction of the musical
part of the festivity was intrusted to Mendelssohn.
The text for the hymn to be sung at
the unveiling, which occurred on the morning of
<span class="pb" id="pg_264">[264]</span>
June 24, immediately after the public service in
Church, was furnished by Adolphus Pr&ouml;lsz, a teacher
in the Gymnasium at Freiberg. Lampadius, in his
Life of Mendelssohn, says of the performance:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Mendelssohn arranged it with trombone accompaniment.
When the opening words, &lsquo;Fatherland!
within thy Confines broke the dawning Light,&rsquo;&mdash;so
the opening ran, if my memory is correct,&mdash;were
heard in the Music Hall at the first rehearsal, the
heartiest applause arose among the performers as
well as the invited guests. Nothing so simple, powerful,
joyous, and unconstrained had been heard for a
long time.... Many will remember how, on the very
day of the public performance, the slight form of Mendelssohn
was seen moving nervously around to find
just the right place for the trombonists, and how
nearly he came to a fall from the platform. During
that performance the singers were divided into two
choirs, which sat at some distance from each other;
one of them was conducted by David, and the other
by Mendelssohn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cantata opens with a stately chorale (&ldquo;With
solemn Hymn of Praise&rdquo;) set to the old tune &ldquo;Honor
to God alone,&rdquo; followed by the song in memory of
Gutenberg (&ldquo;Fatherland! within thy Confines&rdquo;),
which has been separately arranged and printed as
a solo. The third number is a quick, spirited
movement for tenors (&ldquo;And God said, &lsquo;Let
there be Light&rsquo;&rdquo;) followed by another effective
chorale (&ldquo;Now, thank God all&rdquo;), which brings the
work to a close. On the afternoon of the same
<span class="pb" id="pg_265">[265]</span>
day Mendelssohn&rsquo;s much more important work, &ldquo;The
Hymn of Praise,&rdquo; was given. A sketch of this has
already appeared in the &ldquo;Standard Oratorios.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div id="c083" title="Lauda Sion">
<h4>Lauda Sion.</h4>
<p>The &ldquo;Lauda Sion,&rdquo; or sequence sung at High
Mass on the Feast of Corpus Christi, was chosen by
Mendelssohn as the subject of one of his most
beautiful cantatas, for four solo voices, chorus, and
orchestra. The majestic rhythm of Saint Thomas
Aquinas&rsquo;s verses loses none of its stateliness in this
musical setting. The work was composed for the
celebration of this Festival by the Church of St.
Martin at Li&egrave;ge, and was first performed there June
11, 1846. Chorley, the English critic who accompanied
Mendelssohn on that occasion, has left us in
his &ldquo;Modern German Music&rdquo; an interesting sketch
of its first production. He says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The early summer of 1846 was a great year for the
Rhine Land and its adjacent district; since there the
Lower Rhenish Festival at Aix-la-Chapelle was conducted
by Mendelssohn, and starred by Mlle. Jenny
Lind; and within a fortnight afterwards was celebrated
at Li&egrave;ge the &lsquo;F&ecirc;te Dieu,&rsquo; for which his &lsquo;Lauda Sion&rsquo;
was written....</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;It was a pity that those who had commissioned
such a composer to write such a work had so entirely
miscalculated their means of presenting it even respectably.
The picturesque old Church of St. Martin
is one of those buildings which swallow up all sound,
<span class="pb" id="pg_266">[266]</span>
owing to the curve of the vaults and the bulk of the
piers; the orchestra was little more powerful, when
heard from below, than the distant scraping of a
Christmas serenade far down the street; the chorus
was toneless, and out of tune; and only one solo
singer, the soprano, was even tolerable. On arriving
at Li&egrave;ge with the purpose of conducting his work,
Mendelssohn gave up the matter in despair. &lsquo;No!
it is not good, it cannot go well, it will make a bad
noise,&rsquo; was his greeting to us....</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;We drove with him that afternoon up to St. Martin&rsquo;s
Church, to hear, as he merrily styled it, &lsquo;the execution
of his music.&rsquo; The sight of the steep, narrow,
winding street, decked out with fir-trees and banners
and the escutcheons of the different towns of Belgium,
pleased him, for he was as keen a lover of a show as
a child, and had a true artist&rsquo;s quick sense of the
picturesque....</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Not envy&rsquo;s self could have helped being in pain
for its composer, so slack and tuneless and ineffective
was the execution of this clear and beautiful work,
by a scrannel orchestra, and singers who could hardly
be heard, and who evidenced their nationality by resolutely
holding back every movement. But in the last
verse, <i>alla breve</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Ecce panis angelorum&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="bq">there came a surprise of a different quality. It was
scenically accompanied by an unforeseen exposition
of the Host, in a gorgeous gilt tabernacle, that slowly
turned above the altar, so as to reveal the consecrated
elements to the congregation. Incense was swung
from censers, and the evening sun, breaking in with a
sudden brightness, gave a fairy-like effect to the curling
fumes as they rose; while a very musical bell, that
<span class="pb" id="pg_267">[267]</span>
timed the movement twice in a bar, added its charm
to the rite. I felt a quick grasp on my wrist, as
Mendelssohn whispered to me, eagerly, &lsquo;Listen! how
pretty that is! it makes amends for all their bad playing
and singing,&mdash;and I shall hear the rest better some
other time.&rsquo; That other time I believe never came
for the composer of the &lsquo;Lauda Sion,&rsquo;&mdash;since this was
only the year before his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work is composed in seven numbers. After
a short introduction the voices give out the theme,
&ldquo;Lauda Sion,&rdquo; followed by a chorus, &ldquo;Laudis
Thema,&rdquo; full of devotional spirit. The soprano
then enunciates in the &ldquo;Sit Laus plena&rdquo; phrases
repeated by the chorus, followed by a beautifully
accompanied quartet, &ldquo;In hac Mensa.&rdquo; The fifth
number is a solemn chorale in unison, leading to
a soprano solo in the arioso style, &ldquo;Caro cibus,&rdquo;
which is exquisitely beautiful. The work concludes
with a very dramatic solo and chorus, &ldquo;Sumit unus,&rdquo;
set to the words &ldquo;Bone pastor,&rdquo; and the closing
verses of the hymn itself. Short as the cantata is,
it is one of the most felicitous of all Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
settings of the ritual.</p>

<h3>MOZART.</h3>
<p>Johann Chrysostomus Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart, one of
the most remarkable of musical geniuses,
and the only one of his contemporaries
whose operas still hold the stage with unimpaired
freshness, was born at Salsburg, Jan. 27, 1756. He
was the son of Leopold Mozart, the Salzburgian
Vice-Capellmeister, who gave him and his sister
Nannerl their earliest instruction in music, and with
such good results that the children travelled and
gave concerts with great success. Before he was
seven years of age he had composed several pieces
for piano and violin, his earliest having been written
at the age of five. At twelve he became court
capellmeister in Salzburg. After his musical travels
he went to Vienna, and there began his period
of classic activity, which commenced with &ldquo;Idomeneus,&rdquo;
reached its culmination in &ldquo;Don Giovanni,&rdquo;
and closed with the &ldquo;Requiem,&rdquo;&mdash;the
&ldquo;swan-song&rdquo; of his wonderful career. In his brief
life Mozart composed more than fifty great works,
besides hundreds of minor ones in every possible
<span class="pb" id="pg_269">[269]</span>
form of musical writing. His greatest compositions
may be classed in the following order: &ldquo;Idomeneus&rdquo;
(1780); &ldquo;Entf&uuml;hrung aus dem Serail&rdquo; (1781);
&ldquo;Figaro&rsquo;s Hochzeit&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Marriage of Figaro&rdquo;),
(1785); &ldquo;Don Giovanni&rdquo; (1787); &ldquo;Cosi fan
Tutti,&rdquo; &ldquo;Zauberfl&ouml;te&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Magic Flute&rdquo;), and
&ldquo;Titus&rdquo; (1790); and the &ldquo;Requiem&rdquo; (1791, the
year of his death). The catalogue of Mozart&rsquo;s
works is an immense one, for his period of productivity
was unusually long. From the age of five
to his death there was not a year that was not
crowded with his music. Besides his numerous
operas, of which only the more famous are given
above, he wrote a large number of symphonies (of
which the &ldquo;Jupiter&rdquo; is now the best known), sonatas,
concertos, for all kinds of instruments, even
to musical-glasses, trios, quartets, quintets, and sextets
for all possible combinations of instruments,
marches, fugues, masses, hymns, arias of extraordinary
brilliancy, liturgies, cantatas, songs and ballads,
and indeed every form of music that is now
known. His style was studied by Beethoven, and
so closely imitated that the music of his first period,
if published without autograph, would readily be
attributed to Mozart. His style was so spontaneous
and characteristic that it has been well said there is
but one Mozart. The distinguishing trait of his
music is its rich melodic beauty and its almost
ravishing sweetness. His melody pours along in a
bright unbroken stream that sometimes even overflows
its banks, so abundant is it. It is peculiarly
<span class="pb" id="pg_270">[270]</span>
the music of youth and spring-time, exquisite in
form, graceful in technique, and delightful in expression.
It was the source where all his immediate
successors went for their inspiration, though
it lacked the maturity, majesty, and emotional
depths which were reached by such a Titan as
Beethoven. Old as it is, and antiquated in form,
especially as compared with the work of the new
schools, its perennial freshness, grace, and beauty
have made it immortal.</p>

<div id="c085" title="King Thamos">
<h4>King Thamos.</h4>
<p>The historical drama, &ldquo;Thamos, King of Egypt,&rdquo;
was written by Freiherr von Gebler. Otto Jahn, in
his Life of Mozart, gives the following sketch of its
story:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">
&ldquo;Menes, King of Egypt, has been deposed by a
usurper, Rameses, and, as it is thought, assassinated;
but he is living, under the name of Sethos, as high priest
of the Temple of the Sun, the secret being known only
to the priest Hammon and the general Phanes. After
the death of Rameses, his son Thamos is heir to the
throne. The day arrives when Thamos attains majority,
is to be invested with the diadem, and to select
a bride. The friends of Menes seek in vain to persuade
him to dispute the throne. He will not oppose
the noble youth, whom he loves and esteems. But
Pheron, a prince and confidant of Thamos, has, in
conjunction with Mirza, the chief of the Virgins of the
Sun, organized a conspiracy against Thamos, and won
<span class="pb" id="pg_271">[271]</span>
over a portion of the army. Tharsis, daughter of
Menes, who is believed by all, even her father, to be
dead, has been brought up by Mirza under the name
of Sais. It is arranged that she shall be proclaimed
rightful heir to the throne, and, as she will then have
the right to choose her consort, Mirza will secure her
beforehand for Pheron. When she discovers that
Sais loves Thamos, and he her, she induces Sais to
believe that Thamos prefers her playmate Myris, and
Sais is generous enough to sacrifice her love and her
hopes of the throne to her friend. Equally nobly
Thamos rejects all suspicions against Pheron, and
awards him supreme command. As the time for action
draws near, Pheron discloses to Sethos, whom
he takes for a devoted follower of Menes, and consequently
for an enemy to Thamos, the secret of Sais&rsquo;
existence and his own plans. Sethos prepares secretly
to save Thamos. Sais also, after being pledged
to silence by an oath, is initiated into the secret by
Mirza and Pheron, and directed to choose Pheron.
She declines to give a decided answer, and Pheron
announces to Mirza his determination to seize the
throne by force in case of extremity. Sais, who believes
herself not loved by Thamos, and will not therefore
choose him as consort, but will not deprive him
of the throne, takes the solemn and irrevocable oath
as Virgin of the Sun. Thamos enters, and they discover,
to their sorrow, their mutual love. Sethos,
entering, enlightens Thamos as to the treachery of
Pheron, without disclosing the parentage of Sais.
Pheron, disturbed by the report that Menes is still
living, comes to take council of Sethos, and adheres
to his treacherous design. In solemn assembly
Thamos is about to be declared king, when Mirza
reveals the fact that Sais is the lost Tharsis, and
<span class="pb" id="pg_272">[272]</span>
heiress to the throne. Thamos is the first to offer her
his homage. When she is constrained to choose
between Thamos and Pheron she declares herself
bound by her oath, and announces Thamos as the
possessor of the throne. Then Pheron calls his followers
to arms, but Sethos steps forward and discloses
himself as Menes; whereupon all fall at his feet in
joyful emotion. Pheron is disarmed and led off;
Mirza stabs herself; Menes, as father and ruler,
releases Sais from her oath, unites her with Thamos,
and places the pair on the throne. A message arrives
that Pheron has been struck with lightning by Divine
judgment, and the piece ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this drama Mozart composed the incidental
music in 1779 and 1780 at Salzburg, where it was
produced under B&ouml;hm and Shickaneder&rsquo;s direction.
The play did not keep the stage long. Mozart
refers to this circumstance in a letter to his father,
written Feb. 15, 1783:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I regret much not being able to make use of the
music for &lsquo;Thamos,&rsquo; for not having pleased here, it
is included among the tabooed pieces, no longer to be
performed. For the sake of the music alone it might
possibly be given again, but it is not likely. It is
really a pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The music consists of five entr&rsquo;actes and three
choruses constructed in a large and majestic style
and specially adapted to ceremonial performance.
The first is a responsive chorus of maidens and
priests (&ldquo;Before thy Light, Sun-god, thy Foe the
Darkness takes Wing&rdquo;) sung in the temple of the
<span class="pb" id="pg_273">[273]</span>
sun at Heliopolis. The second (&ldquo;Godhead, throned
in Power eternal&rdquo;) is also sung in the temple before
Thamos&rsquo; coronation, at the beginning of the
fifth act, and contains short snatches of solos for a
priest and maiden, leading to a close in full harmony
for the voices, and an instrumental finale of
soft music during which the priest offers sacrifice
upon the altar. The third opens with a majestic
bass solo for the high priest (&ldquo;Ye Children of
Dust, come, with Trembling, adore ye&rdquo;) and closes
with a stately strain for all the voices (&ldquo;We Children
of Dust in our Reverence tremble&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Although the play was shelved, the music was not
lost. Mozart subsequently set the choruses to Latin
and German words, and they were adapted as hymns
and motets for church use. They are now familiar
to musicians as &ldquo;Splendente te Deus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Deus tibi
Laus et Honor,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ne Pulvis et Cinis.&rdquo; Nohl
says of them:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">
&ldquo;A certain solemnity pervades them such as few
of his sacred works possess, and an elevation of feeling
only surpassed in the &lsquo;Flauto Magico.&rsquo; But the composer
has relied on theatrical effect; and thus, in spite
of his graver intentions, we find more worldly pomp
than religious depth in these choruses, which Mozart
worked out with all love and care, even in their most
minute details, and which manifest the thoughtful
mood that absorbed his soul.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div id="c086" title="Davidde Penitente">
<div class="pb" id="pg_274">[274]</div>
<h4>Davidde Penitente.</h4>
<p>The cantata &ldquo;Davidde Penitente&rdquo; was the outcome
of a work of love. Before his marriage with
Constance Weber, Mozart vowed that when he
brought her to Salzburg as his wife he would write
a mass for the occasion and have it performed there.
In a letter written to his father, Jan. 4, 1783, he
says: &ldquo;As a proof of the fulfilment of this vow,
the score of a &lsquo;half-mass&rsquo; is now lying by, in hopes
of some day being finished.&rdquo; Holmes, in his
admirable Life of Mozart, says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">
&ldquo;To exercise his pen in the grand contrapuntal
style of church music was at all times agreeable to
him; and he was now free from the local restrictions
under which he had written his numerous masses at
Salzburg, where neither the style, the length of the
pieces, nor their instrumentation was left to his own
discretion; hence, making due allowance for the effect
of some few years in developing the composer&rsquo;s
genius, the great superiority of &lsquo;Davidde Penitente,&rsquo;
by which title this mass was in the sequel better known
over all the earlier masses, as well for breadth of style
as in true ecclesiastical solemnity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;half-mass&rdquo; which Mozart brought to Salzburg
in fulfilment of his vow comprised only the
Kyrie, Gloria, Sanctus, and Benedictus. The remaining
numbers were supplied from another mass,
and in this form the work was produced at St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church, Aug. 25, 1783, his wife taking the
<span class="pb" id="pg_275">[275]</span>
solo part. The original work is described as exceedingly
majestic and beautiful, particularly the
&ldquo;Gratias&rdquo; for five, and the &ldquo;Qui Tollis&rdquo; for eight-voiced
chorus. Jahn says of them that the same
wonderful and mysterious impression of the supernatural
conveyed by the most beautiful numbers in
his Requiem characterizes these choruses.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;half-mass&rdquo; was destined to undergo still
more radical changes. In the spring of 1785 the
committee of the society for the relief of the widows
and orphans of musicians at Vienna wished to celebrate
their annual festival with some new work, and
commissioned Mozart to write a cantata. As the
time was very short, he took the Kyrie and Gloria
of the mass, set Italian words to them, and added
four new numbers, in which form it was produced
under the title of &ldquo;Davidde Penitente&rdquo; at the
Burg-theatre, March 13, the solo singers being
Fraulein Cavalieri,<sup><a id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a></sup>
Fraulein Distler, and Herr
Adamberger.<sup><a id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a></sup>
The cantata comprises ten numbers.
The first number is a chorus (&ldquo;Alzai le flebile voci&rdquo;)
taken from the &ldquo;Kyrie&rdquo; of the mass; the second,
an allegro chorus (&ldquo;Cantiam le lodi&rdquo;), from the
&ldquo;Gloria;&rdquo; the third, a soprano solo (&ldquo;Lungi le
<span class="pb" id="pg_276">[276]</span>
cure&rdquo;), from the &ldquo;Laudamus;&rdquo; the fourth, an
adagio chorus (&ldquo;Sii pur sempre&rdquo;) from the
&ldquo;Gratias;&rdquo; the fifth, a very melodious soprano duet
(&ldquo;Sorgi o Signore&rdquo;), from the &ldquo;Domine Deus;&rdquo;
the sixth, a beautiful tenor aria (&ldquo;A te fra tanti
affanni&rdquo;), written for Adamberger; the seventh,
a double chorus (&ldquo;Se vuoi, puniscimi&rdquo;); the
eighth, a bravura aria for soprano (&ldquo;Fra le oscure
Ombre&rdquo;), written for Mademoiselle Cavalieri; the
ninth, a terzetto (&ldquo;Tutti le mie speranze&rdquo;); and the
tenth, a final chorus and fugue which, by general
consent of the critics of the time, was called the
&ldquo;queen of vocal fugues.&rdquo; Notwithstanding the
introduction of specially-written arias, and the brilliant
music assigned to the soprano, the cantata
is regarded as one of the purest examples of
Mozart&rsquo;s church style.</p>
<div class="fnblock">
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_32" href="#fr_32">[32]</a></sup> Catharina Cavalieri, born in 1761, died June 30, 1801. She
was a singer in Italian and German opera in Vienna from 1775 to
1783; but as she never left that city her reputation was purely
local. Mozart wrote for her the part of Constanza in his opera
&ldquo;Die Entf&uuml;hring.&rdquo;
</div>
<div class="fndef"><sup><a id="fn_33" href="#fr_33">[33]</a></sup> Valentin Adamberger was born at Munich, July 6, 1743, and
was famed for his splendid tenor voice. Mozart composed for
him the part of Belmont in the &ldquo;Entf&uuml;hring,&rdquo; and highly esteemed
him as a friend and adviser. He died Aug. 24, 1804.

<div id="c087" title="The Masonic Cantatas">
<h4>The Masonic Cantatas.</h4>
<p>Mozart became a member of the Masonic fraternity
shortly after his arrival in Vienna in 1784,
and devoted himself to its objects with all the
ardor of his nature. In the following year his
father visited him and was also persuaded to join,
though not without considerable entreaty on the
son&rsquo;s part. He was a devoted member of the
Church and entertained a deep reverence for its
forms. The Church then, as now, was hostile to all
secret orders, and was particularly inimical to the
<span class="pb" id="pg_277">[277]</span>
Masons because they had attacked certain alleged
abuses in the cloisters. His prejudices were overcome,
however, and he soon became as ardent a
devotee of Masonry as his son. It formed one
of the principal subjects of their correspondence;
but unfortunately all these letters were destroyed
by the cautious father a short time before his death,
which occurred May 28, 1787. In only one letter
do we find reference to the subject, and that in a
guarded manner. On the 3d of April of that year
Mozart heard of his father&rsquo;s illness, and the next
day he writes to him:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">
&ldquo;I have this moment heard tidings which distress
me exceedingly, and the more so that your last letter
led me to suppose you were so well; but I now
hear that you are really ill. I need not say how
anxiously I shall long for a better report of you to
comfort me, and I do hope to receive it, though I am
always prone to anticipate the worst. As death (when
closely considered) is the true goal of our life, I have
made myself so thoroughly acquainted with this good
and faithful friend of man, that not only has its image
no longer anything alarming to me, but rather something
most peaceful and consolatory; and I thank my
Heavenly Father that He has vouchsafed to grant
me the happiness, <i>and has given me the opportunity
(you understand me), to learn that it is the key to our
true felicity</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mozart&rsquo;s membership in the order began at an
opportune time for him. Though at the height of
his fame he was at the very lowest depth of his
<span class="pb" id="pg_278">[278]</span>
finances; and both in 1787 and 1789, though he
was Imperial Chamber Musician and his opera
&ldquo;Don Giovanni&rdquo; was having a successful run, he
was obliged to apply repeatedly to his friend and
brother Mason, the merchant Puchberg of Vienna,
for loans, and also to Herr Hofd&auml;mmel, who was
about to become a Mason upon Mozart&rsquo;s solicitation.
During the short remainder of his life he
was devotedly attached to the order, and he was
buried in the dress of the brotherhood; but, strange
to say, not one of the members accompanied their
illustrious associate to the grave.</p>
<p>Four of Mozart&rsquo;s works were directly inspired by
Masonry. In 1785 he wrote a simple but beautiful
lodge song for voice, with piano accompaniment
(&ldquo;Die ihr einern neuen Grade&rdquo;). This was
followed by the wonderfully beautiful &ldquo;Freemason&rsquo;s
Funeral Music&rdquo; for orchestra, written upon the
occasion of the death of two brothers in the fraternity,
of which Jahn says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">
&ldquo;Mozart has written nothing more beautiful, from
its technical treatment and finished effect of sound,
its earnest feeling and psychological truth, than this
short adagio. It is the utterance of a resolute, manly
character, which, in the face of death, pays the rightful
tribute to sorrow without being either crushed or
stunned by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same year he composed a small cantata,
&ldquo;Die Maurerfreude,&rdquo; for tenor and chorus, in honor
of Herr Born, the master of the lodge to which he
<span class="pb" id="pg_279">[279]</span>
belonged in Vienna, which is full of true feeling
combined with graceful melody.</p>
<p>The second cantata, catalogued in K&ouml;chel &ldquo;Eine
Kleine Freimaurer Cantate, &lsquo;Laut verk&uuml;nde unsre
Freude,&rsquo;&rdquo; better known by its title &ldquo;Lob der
Freundschaft&rdquo; (&ldquo;Praise of Friendship&rdquo;) is notable
as the last work written by Mozart. Its date
is Nov. 15, 1791, only three weeks before his
death. At this time he was engaged in finishing
up his &ldquo;Requiem,&rdquo; which had such a depressing
effect upon him that he was ordered by his physician
to lay it aside. The rest he thus secured had
such a good effect that by the middle of November
he was able to attend a Masonic meeting and produce
the little cantata which he had just written
for them. On reaching home after the performance
he said to his wife, &ldquo;O St&auml;nerl, how
madly they have gone on about my cantata! If
I did not know that I had written better things, I
should have thought this my best composition.&rdquo;
It is constructed upon a larger scale than the cantata
of 1785, and is very pleasing and popular, but
lacks the spirit and earnestness of the former. It
has six numbers: 1. Chorus, &ldquo;Laut verk&uuml;nde unsre
Freude;&rdquo; 2. Recitative, &ldquo;Zum ersten Male;&rdquo; 3.
Tenor aria, &ldquo;Dieser Gottheit Allmacht;&rdquo; 4. Recitative,
&ldquo;Wohlan, ihr Br&uuml;der;&rdquo; 5. Duet, &ldquo;Lange
sallen diese Mauern&rdquo;; 6. Chorus, &ldquo;Lasst uns mit
geschlungen H&auml;nden.&rdquo; It was Mozart&rsquo;s swan-song.
Two days after its performance he was
stricken down with his last illness.</p>

<h3>PAINE.</h3>
<p>John K. Paine, one of the very few
really eminent American composers,
was born at Portland, Me., Jan. 9, 1839.
He studied the piano, organ, and composition
with Kotzschmar in that city, and made his
first public appearance as an organist, June 25,
1857. During the following year he went to Germany,
and studied the organ, composition, and
instrumentation with Haupt and other masters in
Berlin. He returned to this country in 1861, and
gave several concerts, in which he played many of
the organ works of the best writers for the first time
in the United States. Shortly after his return he
was appointed instructor of music in Harvard University,
and in 1876 was honored with the elevation
to a professorship and given a regular chair. He is
best known as a composer, and several of his works
have been paid the rare compliment of performance
in Germany, among them his Mass in D and all his
symphonies. The former was given at the Berlin
Singakademie in 1867, under his own direction.
Among his principal compositions are the oratorio
&ldquo;St. Peter,&rdquo; the music to &ldquo;&OElig;dipus,&rdquo; the cantatas,
<span class="pb" id="pg_281">[281]</span>
&ldquo;Nativity,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Realm of Fancy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ph&oelig;bus,
Arise;&rdquo; the Mass in D; the Centennial Hymn, set
to Whittier&rsquo;s poem, and sung at the opening of the
Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition; the overture
to &ldquo;As You Like It;&rdquo; &ldquo;The Tempest,&rdquo; in the
style of a symphonic poem; the symphony in C
minor, and &ldquo;Spring&rdquo; symphony; besides numerous
sonatas, fantasias, preludes, songs, and arrangements
for organ and piano. His larger orchestral works
have been made familiar to American audiences by
Mr. Theodore Thomas&rsquo;s band, and have invariably
met with success. His style of composition is large,
broad, and dignified, based upon the best classic
models, and evinces a high degree of musical
scholarship.</p>
</div>
<div id="c089" title="&OElig;dipus Tyrannus">
<h4>&OElig;dipus Tyrannus.</h4>
<p>The first public performance of the &ldquo;&OElig;dipus
Tyrannus&rdquo; of Sophocles in this country was given
at the Sanders Theatre (Harvard College), Cambridge,
Mass., May 17, 1881, for which occasion
Mr. Paine composed the music incidental to the
world-famous tragedy. The performance was a
memorable one in many ways. The tragedy was
given in the original language. It was the first
event of the kind in America. The audience was
a representative one in culture, education, and social
brilliancy. The programme was also unique, being
printed in Greek, and translated into English was

<div class="pb" id="pg_283">[283]</div>
<p class="tb">The story of the Theban hero, his ignorance of his
own parentage, his dismay at the revelation of the
oracle that he would kill his father and marry his
mother, his quarrel with the former, resulting in the
very tragedy he was seeking to avoid, his solution of
the riddle of the sphinx, the reward of the Queen&rsquo;s
hand which Creon had promised, leading to the
unfortunate marriage with his mother, Jocasta, thus
completing the revelation of the oracle, does not
need description in detail. The marriage was followed
<span class="pb" id="pg_284">[284]</span>
by a pestilence that wasted Thebes, and at
this point the plot of the drama begins. It concerns
itself with the efforts of &OElig;dipus to unravel
the mystery of the death of his father, Laius, which
lead to the discovery that he himself was the murderer,
and that he had been guilty of incest with
his own mother. Jocasta hangs herself, and &OElig;dipus,
rushing frantically into the palace, beholds her, and
overwhelmed with horror at the sight and the fulfilment
of the oracle, seizes her brooch-pin and blinds
himself. In the &OElig;dipus at Colonos the sequel is
told. The hero dies in the gardens of the Eumenides,
happy in the love of his daughters and the
pardon which fate grants him.</p>
<p>The music to the tragedy is thoroughly classical
in spirit, and has all the nobility, breadth, dignity,
and grace characteristic of the Greek idea. The
principal lyric movements of the chorus, the choral
odes, of which there are six, comprise the scheme
of the composer. The melodramatic practice of
the orchestra accompanying spoken dialogue only
appears to a limited extent in the third ode; and
the chorus, as narrator, is accompanied by music
only in the seven last lines of the play, which form
the postlude. The orchestral introduction, which
is treated in a very skilful and scholarly manner,
epitomizes the spirit of the work. The odes are
divided as usual into strophes and antistrophes,
assigned alternately to a male chorus of fifteen and
full chorus. The first (&ldquo;Oracle sweet-tongued of
Zeus&rdquo;), which has the genuine antique dignity and
<span class="pb" id="pg_285">[285]</span>
elevation, is a description of the sufferings of the
people from the pestilence which has wasted Thebes
since the unnatural marriage of &OElig;dipus and Jocasta,
and a fervent prayer to the gods for aid. The second
(&ldquo;Thou Delphic Rock, who can he be?&rdquo;)
concludes the scene where the blind prophet Teiresias
arrives upon the summons of Creon and accuses
&OElig;dipus of the crime, accompanying the
accusation with dark hints of further guilt. In this
ode, which is specially noticeable for its rich and
graceful treatment, the chorus expresses its disbelief
of the charges. In the third scene, Creon enters to
protest against the accusations of &OElig;dipus, but a
quarrel ensues between them, which results in the
menace of death to the former. Jocasta appears,
and upon her intercession Creon is allowed to
depart. In the ode, the chorus joins in this appeal
to &OElig;dipus,&mdash;a strong, vigorous number, the effect
of which is heightened by the intervening spoken
parts of Creon, &OElig;dipus, and Jocasta, with musical
accompaniment. The fourth ode (&ldquo;O may my
Life be spent in Virtue&rdquo;) is a vigorous denunciation
of the impiety of Jocasta in speaking scornfully
of the oracles. The fifth ode (&ldquo;If I the Prophet&rsquo;s
Gift possess&rdquo;) is full of idyllic grace and sweetness,
realizing in a remarkable degree the old Grecian
idea of sensuous beauty. It is a speculation upon
the divine origin of &OElig;dipus, after the messenger
relates the story of the King&rsquo;s exposure in his childhood
upon Mount Cith&aelig;ron, and contains a charming
tenor solo. The last ode (&ldquo;O Race of mortal
<span class="pb" id="pg_286">[286]</span>
Men&rdquo;) bewails the vicissitudes of fortune, and is
full of the tragic significance of impending fate.
The work comes to a close with the postlude:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ye who dwell in Thebes our city, fix on &OElig;dipus your eyes,</p>
<p class="t0">Who resolved the dark enigma, noblest liver and most wise.</p>
<p class="t0">Glorious like a sun he mounted, envied of the popular throng,</p>
<p class="t0">Now he sinks in seas of anguish, quenched the stormy waves among.</p>
<p class="t0">Therefore I await the final hour, to ancient wisdom known,</p>
<p class="t0">Ere I call one mortal happy. Never shall that thought be shown,</p>
<p class="t0">Till he end his earthly being, scathless of a sigh or groan.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Six public performances of the &ldquo;&OElig;dipus&rdquo; were
given in 1881, and every season since that time
selections from the music have been performed in
New York, Boston, and other cities. As the most
important and scholarly work an American composer
has yet produced, it cannot be heard too
often.</p>
</div>
<div id="c090" title="The Nativity">
<h4>The Nativity.</h4>
<p>The text of &ldquo;The Nativity,&rdquo; for chorus, solo
voices, and orchestra, is taken from the hymn in
Milton&rsquo;s ode &ldquo;On the Morning of Christ&rsquo;s Nativity,&rdquo;
and is composed in three parts. The first part includes
the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh;
the second, a combination of the eighth and ninth;
and the third, the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
verses. After a short instrumental introduction,
which works up to an effective climax, the cantata
begins with a chorus (&ldquo;It was the Winter wild&rdquo;),
introduced by the soprano, developing to full harmony
<span class="pb" id="pg_287">[287]</span>
at the words, &ldquo;Nature in Awe to Him,&rdquo; and
closing pianissimo. After a short soprano solo
(&ldquo;But, He her Fears to cease&rdquo;) the chorus resumes
(&ldquo;With Turtle Wing the amorous Clouds dividing&rdquo;).
A succession of choral passages follows, admirably
suggestive of the sentiment of the poem,&mdash;a
vigorous, stirring allegro, &ldquo;No War or Battle&rsquo;s
Sound was heard the World around;&rdquo; &ldquo;And Kings
sat still with awful Eye,&rdquo; broadly and forcibly written;
and a tender, graceful number, &ldquo;But peaceful was
the Night.&rdquo; They are followed by another soprano
solo (&ldquo;And though the shady Gloom&rdquo;), full of
brightness and animation, which leads directly to a
majestic chorus (&ldquo;He saw a greater Sun appear&rdquo;),
which closes the first part.</p>
<p>The second part, a quartet and chorus, is pastoral
in character, and reflects the idyllic quiet and beauty
of the text. The quartet, &ldquo;The Shepherds on the
Lawn,&rdquo; is introduced by short tenor, bass, and alto
solos, and also contains a very melodious and graceful
solo for soprano (&ldquo;When such Music sweet
their Hearts and Ears did greet&rdquo;), after which the
full quartet leads up to a vigorous chorus (&ldquo;The
Air such Pleasure loath to lose&rdquo;), closing the part.</p>
<p>The third part is choral, and forms an effective
climax to the work. It opens with the powerful
chorus, &ldquo;Ring out, ye crystal Spheres,&rdquo; emphasized
by the organ bass with stately effect, and
moves on majestically to the close,&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And Heaven as at some festival</p>
<p class="t0">Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c091" title="The Realm of Fancy">
<div class="pb" id="pg_288">[288]</div>
<h4>The Realm of Fancy.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Realm of Fancy&rdquo; is a short cantata, the
music set to Keats&rsquo;s familiar poem:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ever let the fancy roam,</p>
<p class="t0">Pleasure never is at home:</p>
<p class="t0">At a touch sweet pleasure melteth,</p>
<p class="t0">Like to bubbles when rain pelteth.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>With the exception of a dozen lines, the dainty poem
is used entire, and is set to music with a keen appreciation
of its graceful beauty. A short allegretto
fancifully trips along to the opening chorus (&ldquo;Ever
let the Fancy roam&rdquo;), which is admirable for its
shifting play of musical color. A soprano solo
(&ldquo;She will bring in spite of Frost&rdquo;), followed by
a very expressive barytone solo (&ldquo;Thou shalt
at a Glance behold the Daisy and the Marigold&rdquo;),
leads up to a charming little chorus (&ldquo;Shaded
Hyacinth, always Sapphire Queen&rdquo;). A short
instrumental passage, in the time of the opening
allegretto, introduces the final chorus (&ldquo;O Sweet
Fancy, let her loose&rdquo;), charmingly worked up,
and closing in canon form. The cantata is very
short; but rarely have poem and music been
more happily wedded than in this delightful tribute
to fancy.</p>
</div>
<div id="c092" title="Ph&oelig;bus, Arise">
<div class="pb" id="pg_289">[289]</div>
<h4>Ph&oelig;bus, Arise.</h4>
<p>Mr. Paine&rsquo;s ripe scholarship is shown to admirable
advantage in his selection of the poem &ldquo;Ph&oelig;bus,
Arise&rdquo; from among the lyrics of the old Scottish
poet, William Drummond, of Hawthornden, and the
characteristic old-style setting he has given to it.
Like &ldquo;The Realm of Fancy,&rdquo; it is very short; but
like that cantata, also, it illustrates the versatility of
his talent and the happy manner in which he preserves
the characteristics of the poem in his music.
Drummond, who has been called &ldquo;the Scottish
Petrarch,&rdquo; and whose poems were so celebrated that
even Ben Jonson could find it in his way to visit him,
was noted for the grace and lightness of his verse,
and the pensive cast with which it was tinged. It has
little of the modern poetic style, and the composer
has clothed his poem in a musical garb to correspond.</p>
<p>The cantata is written for tenor solo, male chorus,
and orchestra, and opens with a brilliant chorus
(&ldquo;Ph&oelig;bus, arise, and paint the sable Skies with
azure, white, and red&rdquo;), closing with a crescendo in
the old style. An expressive and somewhat pensive
tenor solo follows:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;This is that happy morn</p>
<p class="t0">And day, long-wish&egrave;d day,</p>
<p class="t0">Of all my life so dark</p>
<p class="t0">(If cruel stars have not my ruin sworn</p>
<p class="t0">And fates my hope betray),</p>
<p class="t0">Which purely white deserves</p>
<p class="t0">An everlasting diamond should it mark.</p>
<p class="t0">This is the morn should bring unto the grove</p>
<p class="t0">My love, to hear, and recompense my love.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_290">[290]</div>
<p>A short choral passage with tenor solo (&ldquo;Fair King,
who all preserves&rdquo;) leads to a full rich chorus (&ldquo;Now,
Flora, deck thyself in fairest Guise&rdquo;). In the next
number the chorus returns to the opening theme
(&ldquo;Ph&oelig;bus, Arise&rdquo;), and develops it with constantly
increasing power to the close.</p>

<h3>PARKER.</h3>
<p>Horatio W. Parker, a young American
composer of more than ordinary
promise, was born at Auburndale, Mass.,
Sept. 15, 1863. After his fifteenth year
he began the study of music, taking his earlier
lessons of the three Boston teachers, Stephen A.
Emery, John Orth, and G. W. Chadwick. In 1882
he went to Munich and studied the organ and composition
with Josef Rheinberger, for three years.
In the spring of 1885 he wrote the cantata &ldquo;King
Trojan,&rdquo; and it was produced for the first time in
that city with success during the summer of the
same year. Since then it has been given in this
country by Mr. Jules Jordan, of Providence, R. I.,
Feb. 8, 1887. His string quartet in F major was
played at a concert of the Buffalo Philharmonic
Society in January, 1886; and a short scherzo was
performed by the Van der St&uuml;cken orchestra in New
York City in the same year. Besides these compositions,
he has written three overtures, quite a number
of songs and pieces for the piano-forte, and
a symphony in C, and ballade for chorus and
<span class="pb" id="pg_292">[292]</span>
orchestra, both of which were played in Munich last
year. In 1886 he accepted the professorship of
music at the Cathedral School of St. Paul, Garden
City, L. I., and in February, 1887, went to New
York, where he now resides, to take charge of a boy
choir in St. Andrew&rsquo;s Church, Harlem.</p>
</div>
<div id="c094" title="King Trojan">
<h4>King Trojan.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;King Trojan,&rdquo; composed for chorus, solos, and
orchestra, was written in March, 1885, and first performed
in July of the same year, at Munich. Its
story is the poem of the same name, by Franz Alfred
Muth, the English version being a free and excellent
translation by the composer&rsquo;s mother, Mrs. Isabella
G. Parker, of Auburndale, Mass.</p>
<p>After a short and graceful introduction, the cantata
opens with a solo describing the quiet beauty
of a summer night, daintily accompanied by wind
instruments and harp. A second voice replies (&ldquo;O
Summer Night&rdquo;), and then the two join in a very
vigorous duet (&ldquo;O fill thou Even with Light of
Heaven&rdquo;). A short solo for third voice leads up to
a chorus which gives us a picture of King Trojan&rsquo;s
castle gleaming in the moonlight. It is followed by
a very effective solo for the King (&ldquo;The Horse is
neighing, O Page of mine&rdquo;), in which he bids his
Page saddle his steed for a night ride to visit his
distant love. The chorus intervenes with a reflective
number (&ldquo;What thinks she now?&rdquo;), which is very
<span class="pb" id="pg_293">[293]</span>
dramatic in style, describing the mutual longing of
the lovers to be together.</p>
<p>The second scene opens with a short solo by the
Page (&ldquo;Up, up, O King, the Horses wait&rdquo;), followed
by the chorus as narrator, describing the ride
of the King and his companion through the greenwood,
with which is interwoven Trojan&rsquo;s solo (&ldquo;How
sweet and cool is yet the Night&rdquo;). In the next
number, a vivacious allegro, the story of the ride is
continued by the chorus, with a characteristic accompaniment,
and again Trojan sings a charming
tribute to the summer night, which is followed by
responsive solos of the King and the Page, in the
allegro and penseroso style,&mdash;the one singing of the
raptures of night, the other of the gladness of day
and sunlight. A passionate bit of recitative (&ldquo;Now
swift, ye Horses&rdquo;) by Trojan reveals the secret of
the King&rsquo;s haste. He is King of the night, and the
morning ray will be fatal to him. A short choral
number (&ldquo;And forward fly they&rdquo;) brings the first
part to a close with the arrival of the riders at the
Queen&rsquo;s castle.</p>
<p>The second part opens with a beautiful solo, quartet,
and chorus (&ldquo;Good-Night, the Lindens whisper&rdquo;),
which describes the meeting of the lovers,
while</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Beneath the lofty castle gate</p>
<p class="t0">Slumbers the page who so long must wait.</p>
<p class="t0">Then crows the cock, the hour is late.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At this note of warning the Page appeals to his
master to fly, for the sunlight will bring him pain
<span class="pb" id="pg_294">[294]</span>
and harm. The dallying King replies, &ldquo;Hark! how
the Nightingale yet sings.&rdquo; A small chorus intervenes
with the warning, &ldquo;Love is so fleeting, Night
is so fair.&rdquo; The Queen appeals to him, &ldquo;What
seest thou, O King?&rdquo; To which Trojan replies with
agitation, &ldquo;The ruddy Morning, it is my Death.&rdquo;
Again comes the Page&rsquo;s warning. The King springs
up in alarm and hastens to his steed. In a choral
presto movement the ride back is described.
The King conceals himself in a dark thicket, hoping
to escape, but the night has vanished and
the day has begun. Its beams penetrate his refuge,
and with a last despairing cry (&ldquo;Accursed Light,
I feel thee now&rdquo;) he expires. A short choral
passage, with harp accompaniment, brings this very
dramatic and fanciful composition to a close:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;And from his horse the king now falls,</p>
<p class="t">He was but king of the night;</p>
<p class="t0">The sunlight sparkles, the sunlight shines,</p>
<p class="t">But death comes with morning light.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>PARKER.</h3>
<p>James C. D. Parker, an American
composer, was born at Boston, Mass.,
June 2, 1828. He received his primary
education in the schools of that city,
was graduated from Harvard University in 1848, and
immediately thereafter began the study of law. His
love for music, however, was irresistible, and he
soon dropped law-books and entered upon a
thorough course of musical instruction, at first in
Boston, and afterwards at the Conservatory in Leipsic,
where he finished the regular course. He
returned to Boston in 1854, and at once devoted
himself to musical work in which he took a prominent
part, and made an excellent reputation as
pianist, organist, and teacher, as well as composer,
though he has not as yet attempted any very large
or ambitious works. In 1862 he organized an
amateur vocal association under the name of the
Parker Club, which has performed several works
by Gade, Mendelssohn, Berlioz, Schumann, and
others, with success. His most important composition
is the &ldquo;Redemption Hymn,&rdquo; which he
<span class="pb" id="pg_296">[296]</span>
wrote for the Boston Handel and Haydn Society
during the period he was its organist. He has also
held the position of organist and choir-director of
Trinity Church in that city, and of Professor of the
College of Music connected with the Boston University.
During his unostentatious career he has
earned an enviable reputation as an earnest, honest
musician deeply devoted to his art.</p>
</div>
<div id="c096" title="The Redemption Hymn">
<h4>The Redemption Hymn.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Redemption Hymn,&rdquo; for alto solo and
chorus, was written for the Fourth Triennial Festival
of the Handel and Haydn Society, and was first
given on that occasion, May 17, 1877, Anna Louise
Cary-Raymond taking the solo. The words are
taken from Isaiah li. 9-11.</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><span class="sc">Chorus:</span>&mdash;&ldquo;Awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord!</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Awake as in the ancient days, in the generations of old.</p>
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab and wounded the dragon?
Awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord!</p>
<p class="t0"><span class="sc">Solo and Chorus:</span>&mdash;&ldquo;Art thou not it that hath dried the sea,
the waters of the great deep, that hath made the depths of the
sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? Therefore the redeemed
of the Lord shall return and come with singing unto Zion, and
everlasting joy shall be upon their head; they shall obtain
gladness and joy, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The work opens with a brief but spirited orchestral
introduction, which leads to an exultant chorus
(&ldquo;Awake, O Arm of the Lord&rdquo;), changing to a
<span class="pb" id="pg_297">[297]</span>
well-written fugue in the middle part (&ldquo;Art thou
not it?&rdquo;), and returning to the first theme in the
close. The next number is an effective alto solo
(&ldquo;Art thou not it which hath dried the Sea?&rdquo;)
alternating with chorus. It is followed by a slow
movement for alto solo and chorus (&ldquo;Therefore
the Redeemed of the Lord shall return&rdquo;), which
closes very gracefully and tenderly on the words,
&ldquo;Sorrow and Mourning shall flee away.&rdquo; This little
work has become a favorite with singing societies,
by the scholarly and effective manner in which it is
written.</p>

<h3>RANDEGGER.</h3>
<p>Alberto Randegger was born at
Trieste, April 13, 1832, and began the
study of music at an early age with Lafont
and Ricci. In his twentieth year he had
written numerous minor pieces of church music,
several masses and two ballets which were produced
with success in his native city. From 1852 to 1854
he was engaged as a conductor in the theatres of
Fiume, Zera, Brescia, and Venice. In the latter
year he brought out a grand opera in Brescia,
called &ldquo;Bianca Capello,&rdquo; shortly after which he
went to London, where he has since resided and
made a world-wide reputation as a teacher. In
1857 he conducted Italian opera at St. James&rsquo;s
Theatre; in 1864 brought out a comic opera, &ldquo;The
Rival Beauties,&rdquo; at the Theatre Royal, Leeds; in
1868 was appointed Professor of Singing at the
Royal Academy of Music, in which he has since
become a director; in 1879-80 was conductor for
the Carl Rosa English Opera Company at Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre, London; and has since been
appointed conductor of the Norwich Festival in the
<span class="pb" id="pg_299">[299]</span>
place of Benedict. His principal works, besides
those already mentioned, are: &ldquo;Medea,&rdquo; a scena,
sung by Madame Rudersdorff at the Gewandhaus,
Leipsic (1869); the One hundred and fiftieth
Psalm, for soprano solo, chorus, orchestra, and organ
(1872); cantata, &ldquo;Fridolin&rdquo; (1873); soprano
scena, &ldquo;Saffo&rdquo; (1875); funeral anthem for the
death of the Prince Consort; and a large number
of songs which are great favorites on the concert-stage.</p>
</div>
<div id="c098" title="Fridolin">
<h4>Fridolin.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Fridolin, or the Message to the Forge&rdquo; was
written for the Birmingham Triennial Musical Festival
of 1873. The words, by Mme. Erminia Rudersdorff,
are founded on Schiller&rsquo;s ballad, &ldquo;Der
Gang nach dem Eisenhammer.&rdquo; The <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>
are Waldemar, Count of Saverne; Eglantine,
Countess of Saverne; Fridolin, page to the Countess;
and Hubert, squire to the Count. The story
closely follows that of Schiller. The preface to the
piano score gives its details as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">
&ldquo;Fridolin and Hubert are in the service of the
Count of Saverne. Hubert, aspiring to win the affections
of his beautiful mistress, conceives a violent
hatred of Fridolin, whom he regards as an obstacle
in his path. Taking advantage of Fridolin&rsquo;s loyal
devotion to the Countess, Hubert excites the jealousy
of the Count, and prompts a stern revenge. The Count
forthwith writes to some mechanic serfs, ordering that
<span class="pb" id="pg_300">[300]</span>
whoever comes asking a certain question shall be at
once thrown into their furnace. Fridolin, innocent of
wrong and unconscious of danger, receives the &lsquo;message
to the forge;&rsquo; but, ere setting out, he waits upon
his mistress for such commands as she might have to
give. The Countess desires him to enter the chapel
he would pass on his way and offer up a prayer for
her. Fridolin obeys, and thus saves his own life;
but vengeance overtakes the traitor Hubert, who, going
to the forge to learn whether the plot has succeeded,
himself asks the fatal question, &lsquo;Is obeyed your lord&rsquo;s
command?&rsquo; and himself becomes the victim. Fridolin
subsequently appears, and is about to perish likewise,
when the Count and Countess, between whom explanations
have taken place, arrive on the scene, to preserve
the innocent and to learn the fate of the guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cantata opens with a short but stirring
prelude, introducing the declamatory prologue-chorus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A pious youth was Fridolin,</p>
<p class="t">Who served the Lord with zeal,</p>
<p class="t0">And did his duty faithfully,</p>
<p class="t">Come thereby woe or weal.</p>
<p class="t0">For this when subtle foe conspired</p>
<p class="t">And sought o&rsquo;er him to boast,</p>
<p class="t0">About his path in direst need</p>
<p class="t">Kept guard the angel host.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The cantata proper opens with a recitative by Fridolin
(&ldquo;Arising from the Lap of star-clad Night&rdquo;),
leading up to the quiet, dreamy air, &ldquo;None but
holy, lofty Thoughts.&rdquo; It is followed by a bass
scena for Hubert (&ldquo;Proceed thou, hateful Minion,
on thy Path&rdquo;) which opens in an agitated manner,
<span class="pb" id="pg_301">[301]</span>
but grows more reposeful and tender in
style as the subject changes in the passage, &ldquo;For
one kind Glance from out those Eyes divine.&rdquo;
Again the scena changes and becomes vigorous
in the recitative, &ldquo;Dispelled by jealous Rage is
Hope&rsquo;s fond Dream,&rdquo; set to an imposing accompaniment,
and leading to a brilliant fiery allegro
(&ldquo;A thousand hideous Deaths I&rsquo;d make him die&rdquo;).
The next number is a very graphic and spirited
hunting-chorus (&ldquo;Hark! the Morn awakes the
Horn&rdquo;), introduced and accompanied by the horns,
and full of breezy, out-door feeling. A long dialogue
follows between Hubert and the Count, somewhat
gloomy in character, in which the former
arouses his master&rsquo;s jealous suspicions. The gloom
still further deepens as Hubert suggests the manner
of Fridolin&rsquo;s death (&ldquo;Mid yon gloomy Mountains&rdquo;).
Then follows the message to the forge by
the Count in monotone phrases (&ldquo;Mark, ye Serfs,
your Lord&rsquo;s Commands&rdquo;) and the scene closes
with a very dramatic duet (&ldquo;Death and Destruction
fall upon his Head&rdquo;). In striking contrast with
these stormy numbers comes the charming, graceful
chorus of the handmaidens (&ldquo;Calmly flow the
equal Hours&rdquo;), followed by a very expressive song
for the Countess (&ldquo;No Bliss can be so great&rdquo;). A
short scene in recitative leads up to a tender duet
(&ldquo;Above yon Sun, the Stars above&rdquo;) for Fridolin
and the Countess, closing with a powerful quartet
for the four principal parts (&ldquo;Now know I, Hubert,
thou speakest true&rdquo;).</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_302">[302]</div>
<p>The ninth scene is admirably constructed. It
opens with an animated and picturesque dance and
chorus of villagers (&ldquo;Song is resounding, Dancers
are bounding&rdquo;), which swings along in graceful
rhythm until it is interrupted by a solemn phrase
for organ, introduced by horns, which prepares the
way for a chorale (&ldquo;Guardian Angels sweet and
fair&rdquo;), closing with Fridolin&rsquo;s prayer at the shrine,
interwoven with a beautiful sacred chorus (&ldquo;Sancta
Maria, enthroned above&rdquo;). In a recitative and ballad
(&ldquo;The wildest Conflicts rage within my fevered
Soul&rdquo;) the Count mourns over what he supposes
to be the infidelity of his wife, followed by a long
and very dramatic scene with the Countess (&ldquo;My
Waldemar, how erred thine Eglantine?&rdquo;). The
last scene is laid at the forge, and after a short
but vigorous prelude opens with a chorus of the
smiths (&ldquo;Gift of Demons, raging Fire&rdquo;), in which
the composer has produced the effect of clanging
anvils, roaring fire, and hissing sparks with wonderful
realism. The chorus closes with passages describing
the providential rescue of Fridolin and the fate
of Hubert, and an <i>andante religioso</i> (&ldquo;Let your
Voices Anthems raise&rdquo;). The epilogue is mainly
choral, and ends this very dramatic work in broad
flowing harmonies.</p>

<h3>RHEINBERGER.</h3>
<p>Joseph Gabriel Rheinberger
was born at Vaduz, in Lichtenstein,
March 17, 1839, and displayed his musical
talent at a very early age. He studied
the piano in his fifth year, and in his seventh
was organist in the church of his native place. At
the age of twelve he entered the Munich Conservatory,
where he remained as a scholar until
he was nineteen, when he was appointed one of its
teachers; at the same time he became organist at
the Hofkirche of St. Michael, and afterwards director
of the Munich Oratorio Society. In 1867
he was appointed professor and inspector of the
Royal Music School, and since 1877 has been the
royal Hofkapellmeister, directing the performances
of the Kapellchor, an organization similar to that of
the Berlin Domchor. He is a very prolific composer,
nearly two hundred works having proceeded
from his pen. Among them are the &ldquo;Wallenstein&rdquo;

</div>
<div id="c100" title="Christophorus">
<h4>Christophorus.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Christophorus,&rdquo; a legend, as Rheinberger calls
it, was written in 1879, and is composed for barytone,
soprano, and alto solos, chorus, and orchestra. Its
subject is taken from the familiar story of the giant
who bore the infant Christ across the flood. The
chorus acts the part of narrator, and in its opening
number relates the legend of Christophorus&rsquo; wanderings
and his arrival before the castle whose
master he would serve. He offers his services, but
when they are accepted as an offering from the
gods he haughtily declares that he only serves &ldquo;for
fame and chivalry.&rdquo; A voice thereupon in an impressive
solo (&ldquo;Trust not this loud-voiced Stranger&rdquo;)
warns him away as an envoy of Satan, and the chorus
repeats the warning. The giant departs with the
intention of drawing his sword in Satan&rsquo;s cause,&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;For he alone must be lord of all,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose name doth so valiant a monarch appall.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In a very picturesque number the chorus describes
his wanderings among the mountain crags and
<span class="pb" id="pg_305">[305]</span>
rocks where Satan weaves his spells about him; and
then suddenly changing to a tender, delicate strain
(&ldquo;Over us Stars shine&rdquo;) anticipates the Voice,
which in a sensuous aria (&ldquo;Who is the sovereign
Lord of the Heart?&rdquo;) sings the power of love. In
graceful chorus the spirits taunt him, whereupon he
once more resolves to fly and to abandon the cause
of Satan, but is thwarted by them. A weird chorus
closes the first part (&ldquo;Satan a-hunting is gone&rdquo;),
ending with an impressive strain:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Stormily falleth the night:</p>
<p class="t0">Frightened maidens fleeing,</p>
<p class="t0">Demon hordes all around.</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;A cross, see, upraised!</p>
<p class="t0">Fly, master! too far we have come.</p>
<p class="t0">Hallowed is the ground.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The second part opens with a reflective soliloquy
by the giant, followed by a plaintive chorus (&ldquo;All
now is lone and silent&rdquo;) describing the suffering of
our Saviour on the cross and the sadness of a hermit
gazing upon the scene. The giant approaches
the latter, and a dialogue ensues between them, in
which the identity of the victim on the cross is revealed.
Having found the King of the universe,
Christophorus determines to devote himself to His
cause, and inquires how he may serve Him. He is
informed he must go to the swiftly-rolling river and
carry the pilgrims across. A chanting chorus (&ldquo;As
flows the River seawards, so onward glide the
Years&rdquo;) describes the work of the faithful toiler.
Then comes a voice calling him, and he beholds an
<span class="pb" id="pg_306">[306]</span>
Infant waiting for him. He takes Him upon his
shoulders and bears Him into the flood, but as he
advances, bends and struggles beneath his load &ldquo;as
though the whole world he bore.&rdquo; He inquires
the meaning, and the Voice replies:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thou bear&rsquo;st the world and bearest its Creator:</p>
<p class="t0">This Child is Jesus, God&rsquo;s own Son.</p>
<p class="t0">Soldier of Christ!</p>
<p class="t0">Thine arms were charity and mercy,</p>
<p class="t0">The arms of love.</p>
<p class="t0">Now mayst rejoice:</p>
<p class="t0">The prize of thy faith is won.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A joyful, exultant chorus, (&ldquo;Blessed of Rivers, the
Child embrace&rdquo;) closes this very graceful little
&ldquo;legend.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div id="c101" title="Toggenburg">
<h4>Toggenburg.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Toggenburg,&rdquo; a cycle of ballads, was written in
1880. The music is for solos and mixed chorus,
the ballads being linked together by motives, thus
forming a connected whole. The story is a very
simple one. The bright opening chorus (&ldquo;At Toggenburg
all is in festive Array&rdquo;) describes the
pageantry which has been prepared to welcome
the return of Henry, Knight of Toggenburg, with
his fair young Suabian bride, the Lady Etha. The
chorus is followed by a duet and alto or barytone
solo, which indicate the departure of the Knight
for the wars, and the Lady Etha&rsquo;s loss of the
wedding ring. The next number, a solo quartet and
chorus (&ldquo;Ah! Huntsman, who gave thee the Diamond
<span class="pb" id="pg_307">[307]</span>
Ring?&rdquo;), is very dramatic in its delineation of
the return of the victorious Knight, who, observing
the ring on the finger of the huntsman, slays him,
and then in a fit of jealousy hurls the Lady Etha
from the tower where she was waving his welcome.
The next number is a female chorus (&ldquo;On mossy
Bed her gentle Form reposes&rdquo;), very slow in its
movement and plaintive in character. It is followed
by a weird and solemn chorus (&ldquo;Through the Night
rings the Horn&rsquo;s Blast with Power&rdquo;), picturing the
mad ride of the Knight through the darkness, accompanied
by the dismal notes of ravens and mysterious
sounds like &ldquo;greetings from the dead,&rdquo;
which only cease when he discovers the corpse
of his lady with the cross on its breast. A short
closing chorus, funereal in style, ends the mournful
story:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Toggenburg all is in mourning array,</p>
<p class="t">The banners wave, the gate stands wide,</p>
<p class="t0">Count Henry returns to his home this day,</p>
<p class="t">In death he anew has won his bride.</p>
<p class="t0">Once more for their coming the hall is prepared,</p>
<p class="t">Where flickering tapers are ranged around,</p>
<p class="t0">And far through the night in the valley are heard</p>
<p class="t">The chants of the monks with their mournful sound.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Though the work has somewhat both of the Schumann
and Mendelssohn sentiment in it, it is nevertheless
original and characteristic in treatment.
The melodies are pleasing throughout, and cover
a wide range of expression, reaching from the
tenderness of love to the madness of jealousy, and
thence on to the elegiac finale.</p>

<h3>ROMBERG.</h3>
<p>Andreas Romberg was born April 27,
1767, at Vechte, near M&uuml;nster. At a
very early age he was celebrated as a
violinist. In his seventeenth year he
made a <i>furor</i> by his playing at the Concerts Spirituels,
Paris. In 1790, with his cousin Bernhard,
who was even more celebrated as a violoncellist
(indeed the Rombergs, like the Bachs, were all
musicians), he played in the Elector&rsquo;s band, and
also went with him to Rome, where the cousins
gave concerts together under the patronage of one
of the cardinals. During the next four years Andreas
travelled in Austria and France, and during
his stay at Vienna made the acquaintance of Haydn,
who was very much interested in his musical work.
In 1800 he brought out an opera in Paris which
made a failure. He then left for Hamburg, where
he married and remained many years. In 1820
he was appointed court capellmeister at Gotha,
and died there in the following year. Among his
compositions are six symphonies; five operas,
&ldquo;Das graue Ungeheuer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Die Macht der Musik,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="pg_309">[309]</span>
&ldquo;Der Rabe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Die Grossmuth des Scipio,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Die Ruinen zu Paluzzi;&rdquo; and several cantatas,
quartets, quintets, and church compositions. Of all
his works, however, his &ldquo;Lay of the Bell&rdquo; is the
best known. A few years ago it was the stock
piece of nearly every choral society in Germany,
England, and the United States; and though now
relegated to the repertory of old-fashioned music,
it is still very popular.</p>
</div>
<div id="c103" title="Lay of the Bell">
<h4>Lay of the Bell.</h4>
<p>The &ldquo;Lay of the Bell&rdquo; was composed in 1808,
the music being set to Schiller&rsquo;s famous poem of
the same name, whose stately measures are well
adapted to musical treatment. It opens with a
bass solo by the Master, urging on the workmen:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;In the earth right firmly planted,</p>
<p class="t">Stands well baked the mould of clay:</p>
<p class="t0">Up, my comrades, be ye helpful;</p>
<p class="t">Let the bell be born to-day.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The full chorus responds in a rather didactic strain
(&ldquo;The Labor we prepare in Earnest&rdquo;), and as it
closes the Master gives his directions for lighting
the fire in the furnace and mixing the metals. In
this manner the work progresses, the Master issuing
his orders until the bell is ready for the casting,
the solo singers or chorus replying with sentiments
naturally suggested by the process and the future
work of the bell. The first of these responses is
<span class="pb" id="pg_310">[310]</span>
the chorus, &ldquo;What in the Earth profoundly hidden,&rdquo;
a smoothly flowing number followed by a
soprano solo (&ldquo;For with a Burst of joyous Clangor&rdquo;),
a pleasantly-rippling melody picturing the joys of
childhood, and a spirited tenor solo (&ldquo;The Youth,
Girl-playmates proudly leaving&rdquo;) indicating the
dawn of the tender passion which broadens out
into love, as the two voices join in the charming
duet, &ldquo;O tender Longing, Hope delightsome.&rdquo;
The bass still further emphasizes their delight in
the recitative, &ldquo;When stern and gentle Troth have
plighted,&rdquo; leading up to a long but interesting tenor
solo (&ldquo;Though Passion gives way&rdquo;) which describes
the homely joys of domestic life. The male
chorus thereupon takes up the story in a joyful
strain (&ldquo;And the good Man with cheerful Eye&rdquo;),
and tells us of the prosperity of the happy pair and
the good man&rsquo;s boast,&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Firm as the solid earth,</p>
<p class="t0">Safe from misfortune&rsquo;s hand,</p>
<p class="t0">Long shall my dwelling stand;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>to which comes the ominous response of the female
chorus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Yet none may with Fate supernal</p>
<p class="t0">Ever form a league eternal;</p>
<p class="t0">And misfortune swiftly strides.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Master now gives the signal to release the
metal into the mould, whereupon follows a stirring
and picturesque chorus (&ldquo;Right helpful is the
Might of Fire&rdquo;) describing the terrors of fire, the
<span class="pb" id="pg_311">[311]</span>
wild alarm, the fright and confusion of the people,
the clanging bells and crackling flames, and the
final destruction of the homestead, closing the first
part.</p>
<p>The second part opens with the anxious orders
of the Master to cease from work and await the result
of the casting. The chorus takes up a slow and
stately measure (&ldquo;To Mother Earth our Work committing&rdquo;)
which closes in a mournful finale describing
the passing funeral train, followed by a pathetic
soprano solo which tells the sad story of the death
of the good man&rsquo;s wife, while &ldquo;To the orphaned
Home a Stranger comes unloving Rule to bear.&rdquo;
The scene now changes from a desolate to a happy
home as the Master bids the workmen seek their
pleasure while the bell is cooling. A soprano solo
takes up a cheery strain (&ldquo;Wends the weary
Wanderer&rdquo;), picturing the harvest home, the dance
of the youthful reapers, and the joys of evening
by the fireside, followed by a tribute to patriotism,
sung by tenor and bass, the pleasant scene closing
with an exultant full chorus (&ldquo;Thousand active
Hands combining&rdquo;). The Master then gives the
order to break the mould, and in contemplation of
the ruin which might have been caused had the
metal burst it, the chorus breaks out in strong,
startling phrases picturing the horrors of civil strife
(&ldquo;The Master&rsquo;s Hand the Mould may shatter&rdquo;).
The work, however, is complete and successful, and
in the true spirit of German Gem&uuml;thlichkeit the
Master summons his workmen:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_312">[312]</div>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Let us, comrades, round her pressing,</p>
<p class="t0">Upon our bell invoke a blessing.</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Concordia,&rsquo; let her name be called:</p>
<p class="t0">In concord and in love of one another,</p>
<p class="t0">Where&rsquo;er she sound, may brother meet with brother.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The cantata closes with a last invocation on the
part of the Master, followed by a jubilant chorus
(&ldquo;She is moving, She is moving&rdquo;).</p>

<h3>SCHUBERT.</h3>
<p>Franz Peter Schubert was born in
Vienna, Jan. 31, 1797, and received his
first musical lessons from his father and
his elder brother Ignaz. In his eleventh
year he sang in the Lichtenthal choir and shortly
afterwards entered the Imperial Convict School,
where for the next three or four years he made
rapid progress in composition. In 1813 he returned
home, and to avoid the conscription entered his
father&rsquo;s school as a teacher, where he remained for
three years, doing drudgery but improving his leisure
hours by studying with Salieri and devoting himself
assiduously to composition. His life had few events
in it to record. It was devoted entirely to teaching
and composition. He wrote in almost every known
form of music, but it was in the Lied that he has
left the richest legacy to the world, and in that field
he reigns with undisputed title. Unquestionably
many of these songs were inspirations, like the
&ldquo;Erl King,&rdquo; for instance, which came to him in
the midst of a carousal. The most famous of
them are to be found in the cycluses &ldquo;M&uuml;llerlieder,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="pg_314">[314]</span>
&ldquo;Die Ges&auml;nge Ossians,&rdquo; &ldquo;Die Geistlichen Lieder,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Die Winterreise,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Der Schwanengesang.&rdquo;
They are wonderful for their completeness, their expression
of passion, their beauty and grace of form,
the delicacy of their fancy, and their high artistic
finish. Among the other great works he has left
are the lovely &ldquo;Song of the Spirits over the Water,&rdquo;
for male voices; &ldquo;Die Allmacht;&rdquo; &ldquo;Prometheus;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Miriam&rsquo;s War Song;&rdquo; the eight-part chorus &ldquo;An
den Heiligen Geist;&rdquo; the &ldquo;Momens Musicale;&rdquo;
impromptus and Hungarian fantasies for piano; the
sonatas in C minor and B flat minor; nine symphonies,
two of them unfinished; the trios in B flat
and E flat; the quartets in D minor and G major;
the quintet in C; two operas, &ldquo;Alfonso and Estrella&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Fierrabras;&rdquo; the mass in G, which he
wrote when but eighteen years of age, and the mass
in E flat, which was his last church composition.
His catalogued works number over a thousand.
He died Nov. 19, 1828, and his last wish was to be
buried by the side of Beethoven, who on his death-bed
had recognized &ldquo;the divine spark&rdquo; in Schubert&rsquo;s
music. Three graves only separate the great
masters of the Symphony and the Lied in the
cemetery of W&auml;hring.</p>
</div>
<div id="c105" title="Miriam&rsquo;s War Song">
<h4>Miriam&rsquo;s War Song.</h4>
<p>The majestic cantata, &ldquo;Miriam&rsquo;s War Song,&rdquo; was
written in March, 1828, the last year of Schubert&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="pg_315">[315]</span>
life,&mdash;a year which was rich, however, in the productions
of his genius. The beautiful symphony in C,
the mass in E flat, the string quartet in C, the three
piano sonatas dedicated to Schumann, the eight-voiced
&ldquo;Hymn to the Holy Ghost,&rdquo; the 92d
Psalm, a &ldquo;Tantum Ergo,&rdquo; and several songs, among
them &ldquo;Am Strom,&rdquo; &ldquo;Der Hirt auf den Felsen,&rdquo; and
a part of the &ldquo;Schwanengesang,&rdquo; all belong to this
year. The authorities differ as to the time of the
first performance of &ldquo;Miriam&rsquo;s War Song.&rdquo; Nottebohm
in his catalogue says that it was first sung
at a concert, Jan. 30, 1829, given for the purpose of
raising funds to erect a monument in memory of the
composer, who died on the 19th of the previous
November. Others assert that Schubert was induced
to give a concert, March 26, 1828, the programme
being composed entirely of his own music, and that
it was first heard on that occasion.</p>
<p>The work is for soprano solo and chorus, the
words by the poet Grillparzer, and the accompaniment,
for the piano, as Schubert left it. He had
intended arranging it for orchestra, but did not live
to complete it. The work, however, was done a year
or two afterwards by his friend Franz Lachner, at
that time officiating as Capellmeister at the K&auml;rnthnerthor
Theatre in Vienna.</p>
<p>The theme of the cantata is Miriam&rsquo;s hymn of
praise for the escape of the Israelites, and the exultant
song of victory by the people, rejoicing not
alone at their own delivery but at the destruction
of the enemy. It opens with a spirited and broad
<span class="pb" id="pg_316">[316]</span>
harmony, &ldquo;Strike the Cymbals,&rdquo; changing to a calm
and graceful song, describing the Lord as a shepherd
leading his people forth from Egypt. The
next number, depicting the awe of the Israelites
as they passed through the divided waters, the approach
of Pharaoh&rsquo;s hosts, and their destruction, is
worked up with great power. As the sea returns
to its calm again, the opening chorus is repeated,
closing with a powerful fugue. The cantata is
short, but it is a work of imperishable beauty.</p>

<h3>SCHUMANN.</h3>
<p>Robert Schumann was born at Zwickau,
in Saxony, June 8, 1810. In his earliest
youth he was recognized as a child of
genius. His first teacher in music was
Baccalaureus Kuntzch, who gave him piano instruction.
He studied the piano with Wieck, whose
daughter Clara he subsequently married, now world-famous
as a pianist. In 1830, in which year his
artistic career really opened, he began the theoretical
study of music, first with Director Kupsch in Leipsic
and later with Heinrich Dorn, and at the same time
entered upon the work of composition. Schumann
was not only a musician but an able critic and
graceful writer; and in 1834, with Schunke, Knorr,
and Wieck, he founded the &ldquo;Neue Zeitschrift f&uuml;r
Musik,&rdquo; which had an important influence upon
musical progress in Germany, and in which the
great promise of such musicians as Chopin and
Brahms was first recognized. He married Clara
Wieck in 1840, after much opposition from her
father; and in this year appeared some of his best
songs, including the three famous cycluses, &ldquo;Liederkreis,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="pg_318">[318]</span>
&ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s Life and Love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Poet&rsquo;s
Love,&rdquo; which now have a world-wide fame. In the
following year larger works came from his pen,
among them his B minor symphony, overture,
scherzo, and finale in E major, and the symphony
in D minor. During this period in his career he
made many artistic journeys with his wife, which
largely increased the reputation of both. In 1843
he completed his great &ldquo;romantic oratorio,&rdquo; &ldquo;Paradise
and the Peri,&rdquo; set to Moore&rsquo;s text, and many
favorite songs and piano compositions, among
them the &ldquo;Phantasiest&uuml;cke&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kinderscenen,&rdquo;
and his elegant piano quintet in E flat. In 1844,
in company with his wife, he visited St. Petersburg
and Moscow, and their reception was a royal one.
The same year he abandoned his &ldquo;Zeitschrift,&rdquo; in
which &ldquo;Florestan,&rdquo; &ldquo;Master Raro,&rdquo; &ldquo;Eusebius,&rdquo;
and the other pseudonyms had become familiar all
over Germany, and took the post of director in
D&uuml;sseldorf, in the place of Ferdinand Hiller. During
the last few years of his life he was the victim
of profound melancholy, owing to an affection of
the brain, and he even attempted suicide by throwing
himself into the Rhine. He was then removed
to an asylum at Endenich, where he died July 20,
1856. The two men who exercised most influence
upon Schumann were Jean Paul and Franz Schubert.
He was deeply pervaded with the romance of the
one and the emotional feeling of the other. His
work is characterized by genial humor, a rich and
warm imagination, wonderfully beautiful instrumentation,
<span class="pb" id="pg_319">[319]</span>
especially in his accompaniments, the loftiest
form of expression, and a rigid adherence to the
canons of art.</p>
</div>
<div id="c107" title="Advent Hymn">
<h4>Advent Hymn.</h4>
<p>In a letter to Strakerjan, Schumann writes:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;To apply his powers to sacred music is the artist&rsquo;s
highest aim. But in youth we are all very firmly rooted
to earth, with its joys and sorrows; in old age the
twigs tend upwards. And so I hope that that day may
not be too far distant from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first of his works indicated in the above
words to his friend was the &ldquo;Advent Hymn,&rdquo;
written in 1848, based upon R&uuml;ckert&rsquo;s poem. It
was followed later by a requiem and a mass, these
comprising his only sacred music.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Advent Hymn&rdquo; describes the entry of
Christ into Jerusalem, reflectively considers his
peaceful career as compared with that of earthly
kings, and appeals to His servants to bear tidings
of Him throughout the world, closing with a prayer
that He will bring His peace to all its people. It
is a hymn full of simple devotion and somewhat
narrow in its limitations; but Schumann has treated
it with all the dignity and breadth of the oratorio
style. It opens with a melodious soprano solo (&ldquo;In
lowly Guise thy King appeareth&rdquo;), with choral responses
by sopranos and altos, leading to an effective
<span class="pb" id="pg_320">[320]</span>
five-part chorus (&ldquo;O King indeed, though no
Man hail Thee&rdquo;), begun by first and second tenors
and basses, and closing in full harmony with the
added female voices. The soprano voice again announces
a subject (&ldquo;Thy Servants faithful, Tidings
bearing&rdquo;), which is taken up by full chorus, in somewhat
involved form, though closing in plain harmony.
The third number (&ldquo;When Thou the stormy Sea
art crossing&rdquo;) is given out by the soprano and repeated
by the female chorus with a charming pianissimo
effect. A few bars for male chorus (&ldquo;Lord
of Grace and Truth unfailing&rdquo;) lead into full chorus.
The fifth number (&ldquo;Need is there for Thyself returning&rdquo;),
also choral, is very elaborately treated with
interchanging harmonies and bold rhythms, leading
up to the final choruses, which are very intricate
in construction, but at the close resolve into a
double chorus of great power and genuine religious
exaltation.</p>
<p>There are other works of Schumann&rsquo;s which are
more or less in the cantata form, such as &ldquo;The
King&rsquo;s Son,&rdquo; op. 116, set to a ballad of Uhland&rsquo;s;
&ldquo;The New Year&rsquo;s Song,&rdquo; op. 144, poem by R&uuml;ckert;
&ldquo;The Luck of Edenhall,&rdquo; op. 143, poem by Uhland;
&ldquo;Of the Page and the King&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; op. 140,
poem by Geibel; the &ldquo;Spanish Love Song,&rdquo; op.
138; the &ldquo;Minnespiel,&rdquo; op. 101; and the &ldquo;Ritornelle,&rdquo;
op. 65.</p>
</div>
<div id="c108" title="The Pilgrimage of the Rose">
<div class="pb" id="pg_321">[321]</div>
<h4>The Pilgrimage of the Rose.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Pilgrimage of the Rose,&rdquo; for solo and
chorus, with piano accompaniment, twenty-four
numbers, was written in the spring of 1851, and was
first performed May 6, 1852, at a D&uuml;sseldorf subscription
concert. The story is taken from a somewhat
vapid fairy-tale by Moritz Horn, and has little
point or meaning. It turns upon the commonplace
adventures of a young girl whose origin is disclosed
by a rose which was never to fall from her hand.</p>
<p>The principal numbers are the opening song, a
joyous hymn to spring, in canon form, for two sopranos;
the dancing choruses of the elves, for two
sopranos and alto; the male chorus, &ldquo;In the thick
Wood,&rdquo; which is very effective in harmony; the exultant
bridal songs, &ldquo;Why sound the Horns so gayly?&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Now at the Miller&rsquo;s;&rdquo; the duet, &ldquo;In the smiling
Valley, &lsquo;mid the Trees so green;&rdquo; the Grave Song;
the quartet, &ldquo;Oh, Joy! foretaste of Heaven&rsquo;s Rest;&rdquo;
and the duet, &ldquo;I know a blushing Rosebud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work as a whole has never attained the popularity
of his &ldquo;Paradise and the Peri,&rdquo; though detached
numbers from it are frequently given with
great success. The inadequacy of the poem has
much to do with this; and it must also be remembered
that it was written at a time when Schumann&rsquo;s
powers had begun to weaken under the strain of the
mental disorder which finally proved fatal. Reissmann,
in his analysis of the work, says:&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="pg_322">[322]</div>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;The man who had hitherto refused to allow even
the simplest composition to flow from any but a distinct
idea, who constantly strove to enter into relations
with some distinct movement of the heart or the imagination,
here grasped at a poem utterly destitute of any
rational fundamental idea, and so arbitrary in execution,
so tasteless in parts, that the musical inspiration
it offered could never have moved any other composer
to set it to music.&rdquo;</p>

and orchestra, was written in 1852, and first performed
in the same year. Its text is based upon
Uhland&rsquo;s beautiful ballad of the same name, which
was adapted for the composer by Richard Pohl.
The libretto shows numerous variations from the
original text. Some of the verses are literally followed,
others are changed, and many new songs and
motives are introduced. Several of Uhland&rsquo;s other
ballads are assigned to the minstrel, the youth, and
the queen, among them &ldquo;Die Drei Lieder,&rdquo; &ldquo;Entsagung,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Hohe Liebe,&rdquo; as well as extracts from
&ldquo;Rudello,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lied des Deutschen S&auml;ngers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gesang
und Krieg,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Das Thal.&rdquo; Instead of the beautiful
verse in the original poem:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;They sing of spring and love, of happy golden youth,</p>
<p class="t0">Of freedom, manly worth, of sanctity and truth.</p>
<p class="t0">They sing of all emotions sweet the human breast that move,</p>
<p class="t0">They sing of all things high the human heart doth love.</p>
<p class="t0">The courtly crowd around forget to sneer and nod,</p>
<p class="t0">The king&rsquo;s bold warriors bow before their God.</p>
<p class="t0">The queen, to pleasure and to melancholy willing prey,</p>
<p class="t0">Down to the singers casts the rose which on her bosom lay,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="pg_323">[323]</div>
<p>which leads up to the tragedy, it is the singing of
the &ldquo;Hohe Liebe&rdquo; which is made the motive by
Pohl, who from this point on follows the story as
told by Uhland.</p>
<p>The work contains fourteen numbers. The first
two verses, describing the castle and its haughty
monarch, are sung by the narrator, and are followed
by an alto solo, very bright and joyous in style,
which tells of the arrival of the two minstrels. The
fourth number is a Proven&ccedil;al song, full of grace and
poetical feeling, sung by the youth, followed by full
chorus. The King angrily interposes in the next
number, &ldquo;Enough of Spring and Pleasure,&rdquo; whereupon
the harper sings a beautiful ballad interpolated
by the librettist. The queen follows with a quiet,
soothing strain, appealing for further songs, and in
reply the youth and harper once more sing of
spring. The youth&rsquo;s powerful song of love, which
changes to a trio in the close, the queen and harper
joining, indicates the coming tragedy, and from this
number on the chorus follows the story as told by
Uhland, with great power and spirit. The general
style of the work is declamatory, but in many of its
episodes the ballad form is used with great skill and
effect.</p>

<h3>SINGER.</h3>
<p>Otto Singer was born in Saxony, July
26, 1833, and attended the Leipsic Conservatory
from 1851 to 1855, studying with
Richter, Moscheles, and Hauptmann. In
1859 he went to Dresden and for two years thereafter
studied with Liszt, of whom he was not only a
favorite scholar but always a most zealous advocate.
In 1867 he came to this country to take a position
in the Conservatory at New York, then under the
direction of Theodore Thomas and William Mason.
In 1873, upon Mr. Thomas&rsquo;s suggestion, he went to
Cincinnati and became the assistant musical director
of the festival chorus of that city, a position which
he filled with eminent ability for several years. At
the festival of 1878 he conducted the first performance
of Liszt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Graner Mass&rdquo; in this country, and
also his own &ldquo;Festival Ode&rdquo; set to a poem by F.
A. Schmitt, and written to commemorate the dedication
of the new Music Hall. In the same year
the Cincinnati College of Music was organized, and
he was engaged as one of the principal instructors,
a position which he still holds, and in which he has
<span class="pb" id="pg_325">[325]</span>
displayed signal ability. Mr. Singer has written many
compositions for piano and orchestra, and besides
his &ldquo;Festival Ode,&rdquo; the cantata &ldquo;Landing of the
Pilgrims&rdquo; (1876).</p>
</div>
<div id="c111" title="The Landing of the Pilgrims">
<h4>The Landing of the Pilgrims.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Landing of the Pilgrims,&rdquo; written in 1876,
was Mr. Singer&rsquo;s Centennial offering to the patriotic
music of that year. The text of the cantata is the
familiar poem written by Mrs. Felicia Hemans, which
was first set to music by her own sister, Miss Browne,
though in somewhat different style from this work of
the modern school.</p>
<p>The cantata opens with an instrumental prelude
which gives out the principal motive as we afterwards
find it set to the words, &ldquo;With their Hymns of
lofty Cheer;&rdquo; and truly lofty cheer it is, that antique,
strong melody. Breathed softly at first, as from afar,
it is repeated after a rapid crescendo with the whole
weight of the orchestra, to melt away again on an
organ point in more subdued tone-color. In the
second movement (andante) it appears in quadruple
time, augmented in its cadence by a chromatic harmony
which serves well to enrich the working-up of
this fine piece of orchestral writing. A short interlude
containing the germ of a second theme, which
afterwards appears at the words, &ldquo;This was their
Welcome Home,&rdquo; now prepares the entrance of the
voices. To the words, &ldquo;The breaking Waves dashed
high,&rdquo; the basses and tenors give out the first motive,
<span class="pb" id="pg_326">[326]</span>
and after declaiming the stormy opening lines of the
poem break forth in unison with &ldquo;When a Band of
Exiles moored their Bark on the wild New England
Shore.&rdquo; The time again changing, the composer
very happily contrasts the phrases, &ldquo;Not as a Conqueror
comes&rdquo; and &ldquo;They the true-hearted came.&rdquo;
Soon, however, the ever-pliable principal theme falls
into a martial stride, and a very effective setting of
the words, &ldquo;Not with the Roll of stirring Drums,&rdquo;
concludes the opening male chorus. Here follows
the Centennial Hymn as given out in the beginning,
sung first by an alto voice, and repeated by the full
chorus of mixed voices. After the close, the orchestra,
dreaming along in the spell, as it were, seems
to spiritualize the sturdy Pilgrim Fathers into meek
Pilgrims of the Cross,&mdash;a piece of exquisite tenderness,
Liszt-Wagnerish, and yet beautiful. After some
alto recitatives and short choral phrases, the leading
theme once more enters with heavy martial step
to the words, &ldquo;There was Manhood&rsquo;s Brow,&rdquo; etc.
The musical setting of the question, &ldquo;What sought
they?&rdquo; etc., is cast in simpler form, and the response,
&ldquo;They sought a Faith&rsquo;s pure Shrine,&rdquo; is given in six
measures, <i>a capella</i>, for five voices. This brings us
to the last movement, <i>andante maestoso</i>. The leading
motive, now contracted into one measure, is
tossed about in the double basses as on the waves of
a heavy surf until it reaches the climax on the words
&ldquo;Freedom to worship God.&rdquo; The cantata forms a
valuable addition to our musical literature, and was
first sung by the Cincinnati Harmonic Society, of
which Mr. Singer was leader at the time.</p>

<h3>SMART.</h3>
<p>Henry Smart, one of the most prominent
of the modern English composers,
was born in London, Oct. 26, 1813.
Though almost entirely self-taught, he
soon made his mark as a musician of more than
ordinary ability. For many years he was principally
known as an organist and organ-writer. He
wrote numerous compositions for that instrument,
which are still largely in use, and from 1836 to 1864
was famous in London for his contributions to the
church service. In 1855 his opera, &ldquo;Bertha, or the
Gnome of Hartzburg,&rdquo; was produced with success
in that city. Among his festival works were the
cantatas, &ldquo;The Bride of Dunkerron,&rdquo; for Birmingham
(1864); &ldquo;King Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s Daughter&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Fishermaidens,&rdquo; for female voices (1871); the sacred
cantata &ldquo;Jacob,&rdquo; for Glasgow (1873); and two
anthems for solos, chorus, and organ, for the London
Choral Choirs&rsquo; Association Festivals of 1876 and
1878. As a writer of part-songs he has also achieved
a wide reputation. Grove states that he also was
&ldquo;a very accomplished mechanic, and had he taken
<span class="pb" id="pg_328">[328]</span>
up engineering instead of music, would no doubt
have been successful. As a designer of organs he
was often employed.&rdquo; Shortly after 1864 he lost
his sight and thereafter composed entirely by dictation.
His services for music secured him a government
pension in June, 1879, but he did not live to
enjoy it, dying July 6 of the same year.</p>
</div>
<div id="c113" title="The Bride of Dunkerron">
<h4>The Bride of Dunkerron.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Bride of Dunkerron,&rdquo; words by Frederick
Enoch, was written for the Birmingham Festival of
1864, and is based upon a tradition, the scene
located at the Castle of Dunkerron, on the coast
of Kerry, which has also been made the subject of
a ballad by Crofton Croker. The story is a very
simple one. The Lord of Dunkerron becomes
enamoured of a sea-maiden, and as she is unable
to leave her element he follows her to her abode.
She seeks the Sea-King to obtain his consent to their
union, but returns to her lover with the sad message
that she is doomed to death for loving a mortal.
He in turn is driven from the Sea-King&rsquo;s realm, and
is cast back by the tempest to the shores of the
upper world; and the work closes with the laments
of the sea-spirits for the maiden, and of the serfs for
their master.</p>
<p>After an expressive orchestral introduction the
cantata opens with a chorus of the serfs (tenors and
basses) (&ldquo;Ere the Wine-cup is dry&rdquo;), followed by
<span class="pb" id="pg_329">[329]</span>
a very romantic chorus of sea-maidens, the two at
times interwoven and responsive,&mdash;the one describing
Lord Dunkerron&rsquo;s nightly vigils on the seashore,
and the other the melody of the maidens
which tempts him. A charming orchestral intermezzo,
full of the feeling of the sea, ensues, and is
followed by recitative and aria (&ldquo;The full Moon
is beaming&rdquo;) for Dunkerron, which is very simple
in style but effective as a song, even apart from its
setting. It leads up to another chorus of the sea-maidens
(&ldquo;Let us sing, the moonlit Shores along&rdquo;)
and a long love dialogue between Dunkerron and
the Maiden. The next number is a very spirited
and picturesque chorus (&ldquo;Down through the
Deep&rdquo;) describing the passage of the lovers to the
Maiden&rsquo;s home, which is followed by a sturdy,
sonorous recitative and aria for bass voice (&ldquo;Oh,
the Earth is fair in Plain and Glade&rdquo;) sung by the
Sea-King. Two very attractive choruses follow, the
first (&ldquo;O Storm King, hear us&rdquo;) with a solo for
the Sea-King, and the second (&ldquo;Hail to thee, Child
of the Earth&rdquo;) by the sea-maidens. Another
graceful melody, &ldquo;Our Home shall be on this bright
Isle,&rdquo; is assigned to the Maiden, leading to a duet
with Dunkerron, in which she announces her departure
to obtain the Sea-King&rsquo;s consent to their
union. A chorus of the storm-spirits (&ldquo;Roar, Wind
of the Tempest, roar&rdquo;) indicates her doom and
leads up to the finale. A powerful trio for the
Maiden, Dunkerron, and Sea-King, followed by
the angry commands of the latter (&ldquo;Hurl him
<span class="pb" id="pg_330">[330]</span>
back!&rdquo;), tells of the death of the lovers, and the
work closes as it opened, with the intermingled
choruses of serfs and sea-maidens, this time, however,
full of lamentation over the sad tragedy.</p>
</div>
<div id="c114" title="King Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s Daughter">
<h4>King Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s Daughter.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;King Ren&eacute;&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; a cantata for female
voices only, the poem by Frederick Enoch, was
written in 1871. The story is freely adapted from
Henrik Hertz&rsquo;s lyric drama. Iolanthe, the daughter
of King Ren&eacute;, Count of Provence, was betrothed
in her infancy to the son of the Count of Vaudemont.
When but a year old she was stricken with
blindness. She has been reared in ignorance of her
affliction by a strict concealment from her of all
knowledge of the blessings of sight. A wandering
magician agrees to cure her by the use of an amulet,
provided she is first informed of the existence of the
missing sense; but her father refuses permission.
Her betrothed has never seen her, but wandering
one day through the valley of Vaucluse, singing his
troubadour lays, he beholds her, and is captivated
by her beauty. His song reveals to her the faculty
of which she has been kept in ignorance, and the
magician, his condition thus having been fulfilled,
restores her to sight.</p>
<p>The work is divided into thirteen numbers, the
solo parts being Iolanthe (soprano), Martha (mezzo-soprano),
and Beatrice (contralto). In the third
<span class="pb" id="pg_331">[331]</span>
number another soprano voice is required in a trio
and chorus of vintagers; and in the sixth number,
a soprano and contralto in the quartet, which acts
the part of narrator, and tells of the troubadour&rsquo;s
rose song to Iolanthe. It is unnecessary to specify
the numbers in detail, as they are of the same general
character,&mdash;smooth, flowing, and graceful in
melody throughout. The most striking of them
are No. 3, trio and chorus (&ldquo;See how gay the
Valley shines&rdquo;); No. 5, arietta for Martha (&ldquo;Listening
to the Nightingales&rdquo;); No. 6, quartet (&ldquo;Who
hath seen the Troubadour?&rdquo;); No. 8, Iolanthe&rsquo;s
song (&ldquo;I love the Rose&rdquo;); No. 11, duet and
chorus (&ldquo;Sweet the Angelus is ringing&rdquo;); and the
finale, with the jubilant chorus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Ren&eacute; the king will ride forth from the gate</p>
<p class="t0">With his horsemen and banners in state;</p>
<p class="t0">And the trumpets shall fanfaron ring</p>
<p class="t0">To Ren&eacute;, to Ren&eacute;, the king.</p>
<p class="t0">Then with rebec and lute and with drum</p>
<p class="t0">The bride in her beauty will come;</p>
<p class="t0">And the light of her eyes, they will say, has surpassed</p>

<h3>SULLIVAN.</h3>
<p>Arthur Seymour Sullivan was
born in London, May 13, 1842. His
father, a band-master and clarinet-player
of distinction, intrusted his musical education
at first to the Rev. Thomas Hilmore, master
of the children of the Chapel Royal. He entered
the chapel in 1854 and remained there three years,
and also studied in the Royal Academy of Music
under Goss and Sterndale Bennett, during this
period, leaving the latter institution in 1858, in
which year he went to Leipsic. He remained in
the Conservatory there until 1861, when he returned
to London and introduced himself to its
musical public, with his music to Shakspeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Tempest,&rdquo; which made a great success. The
enthusiasm with which this was received, and the
favors he gained at the hands of Chorley, at that
time musical critic of the &ldquo;Athen&aelig;um,&rdquo; gave him
a secure footing. The cantata &ldquo;Kenilworth,&rdquo; written
for the Birmingham Festival, the music to the
ballet &ldquo;L&rsquo;&Icirc;le enchant&eacute;e,&rdquo; and an opera, &ldquo;The Sapphire
Necklace,&rdquo; were produced in 1864. In 1866
<span class="pb" id="pg_333">[333]</span>
appeared his first symphony and an overture, &ldquo;In
Memoriam,&rdquo; a tribute to his father, who died that
year. The next year his overture &ldquo;Marmion&rdquo; was
first performed. In 1869 he wrote his first oratorio,
&ldquo;The Prodigal son,&rdquo; in 1873 &ldquo;The Light of the
World,&rdquo; and in 1880 &ldquo;The Martyr of Antioch;&rdquo;
the first for the Worcester, the second for the Birmingham,
and the third for the Leeds festival.
The beautiful &ldquo;Overture di Ballo,&rdquo; so frequently
played in this country by the Thomas orchestra,
was written for Birmingham in 1870, and the next
year appeared his brilliant little cantata, &ldquo;On shore
and Sea.&rdquo; On the 11th of May, 1867, was first
heard in public his comic operetta, &ldquo;Cox and Box.&rdquo;
It was the first in that series of extraordinary successes,
really dating from &ldquo;The Sorcerer,&rdquo; which
are almost without parallel in the operatic world,
and which have made his name, and that of his
collaborator, Gilbert, household words. He has
done much for sacred as well as secular music. In
addition to his oratorios he has written numerous
anthems, forty-seven hymn tunes, two Te Deums,
several carols, part-songs, and choruses, and in 1872
edited the collection of &ldquo;Church Hymns with
Tunes&rdquo; for the Christian Knowledge Society. His
latest works are the opera &ldquo;Ruddygore&rdquo; and the
cantata &ldquo;The Golden Legend,&rdquo; both written in
1886. He received the honorary degree of Doctor
of Music from Cambridge in 1876, and from Oxford
in 1879, and in 1883 was knighted by the Queen.</p>
</div>
<div id="c116" title="On Shore and Sea">
<div class="pb" id="pg_334">[334]</div>
<h4>On Shore and Sea.</h4>
<p>The cantata &ldquo;On Shore and Sea&rdquo; was written
for the London International Exhibition of 1871.
The solo parts are allotted to La Sposina, a Riviera
woman, and Il Marinajo, a Genoese sailor. The
action passes in the sixteenth century, at a port
of the Riviera and on board of a Genoese and
Moorish galley at sea. The cantata opens with a
joyous sailors&rsquo; chorus and the lament of the mothers
and wives as the seamen weigh anchor and set sail.
The scene then changes to the sea. On board one
of the galleys, in the midnight watch, the Marinajo
invokes the protection of Our Lady, Star of the
Sea, for the loved one left behind. The scene
next changes to the return of the fleet, triumphant
in its encounters with the Moorish vessels. The
women throng to the shore, headed by La Sposina,
to welcome the sailors back, but the galley on board
which her lover served is missing. It has been
captured by the Moors, and in a pathetic song she
gives expression to her sorrow. In the next scene
we find him toiling at the oar at the bidding of his
Moorish masters. While they are revelling he plans
a rising among his fellow-captives which is successful.
They seize the galley and steer back to the
Riviera, entering port amid choruses of rejoicing.
The cantata is full of charming melodies, the instrumentation
is Oriental in color, and the choruses,
particularly the closing ones, are very stirring.</p>
</div>
<div id="c117" title="The Golden Legend">
<div class="pb" id="pg_335">[335]</div>
<h4>The Golden Legend.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Golden Legend&rdquo; was first produced at the
Leeds Musical Festival, Oct. 16, 1886. The story
of the legend has already been told in the description
of Mr. Buck&rsquo;s cantata by the same name, which
took the Cincinnati Festival prize in 1880. The
adaptation of Mr. Longfellow&rsquo;s poem for the Sullivan
cantata was made by Joseph Bennett, who while
omitting its mystical parts, except the prologue, has
confined himself to the story of Prince Henry and
Elsie. All the principal scenes, though sometimes
rearranged to suit the musical demands of the
composer, have been retained, so that the unity of
the legend is preserved.</p>
<p>The prologue, representing the effort of Lucifer
and the spirits of the air to tear down the cathedral
cross, is used without change. The part of Lucifer
is assigned to the barytone voice, the spirits of the
air to the sopranos and altos, and the bells to the
tenors and basses, the whole closing with the Gregorian
Chant. The orchestral accompaniment is very
realistic, particularly in the storm music and in the
final number, where the organ adds its voice to
the imposing harmony. The first scene opens with
the soliloquy of Prince Henry in his chamber (&ldquo;I
cannot sleep&rdquo;), followed by a dramatic duet with
Lucifer, describing the temptation, and closes with
a second solo by the Prince, accompanied by
a warning chorus of angels. The second scene
<span class="pb" id="pg_336">[336]</span>
opens before the cottage of Ursula at evening,
with a short alto recitative (&ldquo;Slowly, slowly up
the Wall&rdquo;) with pastoral accompaniment, followed
by a very effective choral hymn (&ldquo;O Gladsome
Light&rdquo;) sung by the villagers ere they depart for
their homes, the Prince&rsquo;s voice joining in the
Amen. The remainder of the scene includes a
dialogue between Elsie and her mother, in which
the maid expresses her determination to die for the
Prince, and a beautiful prayer (&ldquo;My Redeemer
and my Lord&rdquo;) in which she pleads for strength
to carry out her resolution, closing with her noble
offer to the Prince, which he accepts, the angels
responding Amen to the blessing he asks for her.</p>
<p>The third scene opens with Elsie, the Prince, and
their attendants on the road to Salerno where the
cure is to be effected by her sacrifice. They fall in
with a band of pilgrims, among whom is Lucifer in
the disguise of a monk. The two bands part company,
and as night comes on the Prince&rsquo;s attendants
encamp near the sea. The continuity of the narrative
is varied by a simple, graceful duet for the
Prince and Elsie (&ldquo;Sweet is the Air with budding
Haws&rdquo;); the Gregorian music of the pilgrims in
the distance (&ldquo;Cujus clavis lingua Petri&rdquo;); the
mocking characteristic song of Lucifer (&ldquo;Here am
I too in the pious Band&rdquo;), interwoven with the
chant; the song of greeting to the sea by the Prince
(&ldquo;It is the Sea&rdquo;); and a very effective solo for Elsie
(&ldquo;The Night is calm and cloudless&rdquo;), which is repeated
by full chorus with soprano obligato dwelling
<span class="pb" id="pg_337">[337]</span>
upon the words &ldquo;Christe Eleison.&rdquo; The fourth
scene opens in the Medical School at Salerno, and
discloses Lucifer disguised as the physician Friar
Angelo, who receives Elsie and takes her into an
inner apartment, notwithstanding the protests of the
Prince, who suddenly resolves to save her, and finally
effects her rescue. The music to this scene is very
dramatic, and it also contains a short but striking
unaccompanied chorus (&ldquo;O Pure in Heart&rdquo;).</p>
<p>The fifth scene is short. It passes at the door of
Ursula&rsquo;s cottage, where a forester brings the mother
the news of Elsie&rsquo;s safety and of the Prince&rsquo;s
miraculous cure. The dialogue is followed by a
prayer of thanksgiving (&ldquo;Virgin, who lovest the
Poor and Lowly&rdquo;). The last scene opens on the
terrace of the castle of Vautsberg. It is the evening
of the wedding day, and amid the sound of bells
heard in the distance the Prince relates to Elsie the
story of Charlemagne and Fastrada, at the close
of which the happy pair join in an exultant duet.
The cantata ends with a choral epilogue, worked
up to a fine fugal climax in which Elsie&rsquo;s &ldquo;deed
divine&rdquo; is compared to the mountain brook flowing
down from &ldquo;the cool hills&rdquo; to bless &ldquo;the broad and
arid plain.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>WAGNER.</h3>
<p>Richard Wagner, who has been sometimes
ironically called the musician of the
future, and whose music has been relegated
to posterity by a considerable number
of his contemporaries, was born at Leipsic,
May 22, 1813. After his preliminary studies in
Dresden and Leipsic, he took his first lessons in
music from Cantor Weinlig. In 1836 he was appointed
musical director in the theatre at Magdeburg,
and later occupied the same position at
K&ouml;nigsberg. Thence he went to Riga, where he
began his opera &ldquo;Rienzi.&rdquo; He then went to Paris
by sea, was nearly shipwrecked on his way thither,
and landed without money or friends. After two
years of hard struggling he returned to Germany.
His shipwreck and forlorn condition suggested the
theme of &ldquo;The Flying Dutchman,&rdquo; and while on
his way to Dresden he passed near the castle of
Wartburg, in the valley of Thuringia, whose legends
inspired his well-known opera of &ldquo;Tannh&auml;user.&rdquo;
He next removed to Zurich, and about this
time appeared &ldquo;Lohengrin,&rdquo; his most popular
<span class="pb" id="pg_339">[339]</span>
opera. &ldquo;Tristan and Isolde&rdquo; was produced in
1856, and his comic opera, &ldquo;Die Meistersinger
von N&uuml;rnberg,&rdquo; three years later. In 1864 he received
the patronage of King Louis of Bavaria,
which enabled him to complete and perform his
great work, &ldquo;Der Ring der Nibelungen.&rdquo; He laid
the foundation of the new theatre at Baireuth in
1872, and in 1875 the work was produced, and
created a profound sensation all over the musical
world. &ldquo;Parsifal,&rdquo; his last opera, was first performed
in 1882. His works have aroused great opposition,
especially among conservative musicians, for the reason
that he has set at defiance the conventional
operatic forms, and in carrying out his theory of
making the musical and dramatic elements of equal
importance, and employing the former as the language
of the latter in natural ways, has made musical
declamation take the place of set melody, and
swept away the customary arias, duets, quartets, and
concerted numbers of the Italian school, to suit the
dramatic exigencies of the situations. Besides his
musical compositions, he enjoys almost equal fame
as a litt&eacute;rateur, having written not only his own
librettos, but four important works,&mdash;&ldquo;Art and the
Revolution,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Art Work of the Future,&rdquo; &ldquo;Opera
and Drama,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Judaism in Music.&rdquo; His music
has made steady progress through the efforts of such
advocates as Liszt, Von B&uuml;low, and Richter in
Germany, Pasdeloup in France, Hueffer in England,
and Theodore Thomas in the United States. In
1870 he married Frau Cosima von B&uuml;low, the
<span class="pb" id="pg_340">[340]</span>
daughter of Liszt,&mdash;an event which produced
almost as much comment in social circles as his
operas have in musical. He died during a visit to
Venice, Feb. 13, 1883.</p>

<div id="c119" title="Love Feast of the Apostles">
<h4>Love Feast of the Apostles.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Das Liebesmahl der Apostel&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Love
Feast of the Apostles&rdquo;), a Biblical scene for male
voices and orchestra, dedicated to Frau Charlotte
Emilie Weinlig, the widow of the composer&rsquo;s old
teacher, was written in 1843, the year after &ldquo;Rienzi,&rdquo;
and was first performed in the Frauen-Kirche in
Dresden at the Men&rsquo;s Singing Festival, July 6 of
that year.</p>
<p>The work opens with a full chorus of Disciples
(&ldquo;Gegr&uuml;sst seid, Br&uuml;der, in des Herren Namen&rdquo;),
who have gathered together for mutual help and
strength to endure the persecutions with which they
are afflicted. The movement flows on quietly,
though marked by strong contrasts, for several
measures, after which the chorus is divided, a second
and third chorus taking up the two subjects, &ldquo;Uns
droht der M&auml;cht&rsquo;gen Hass,&rdquo; and &ldquo;O fasst Vertrau&rsquo;n,&rdquo;
gradually accelerating and working up to a climax,
and closing pianissimo (&ldquo;Der M&auml;cht&rsquo;gen Sp&auml;h&rsquo;n
verfolgt uns &uuml;berall&rdquo;).</p>
<p>In the next number the Apostles enter (twelve
bass voices) with a sonorous welcome (&ldquo;Seid uns
gegr&uuml;sst, ihr lieben Br&uuml;der&rdquo;), reinforced by the
<span class="pb" id="pg_341">[341]</span>
Disciples, pianissimo (&ldquo;Wir sind versammelt im
Namen Jesu Christi&rdquo;), the united voices at last in
powerful strains (&ldquo;Allm&auml;cht&rsquo;ger Vater, der du hast
gemacht Himmel und Erd&rsquo; und Alles was darin&rdquo;)
imploring divine help and the sending of the Holy
Ghost to comfort them. At its close voices on high
are heard (&ldquo;Seid getrost, ich bin euch nah, und
mein Geist ist mit euch&rdquo;). The Disciples reply
with increasing vigor (&ldquo;Welch Brausen erf&uuml;llt die
Luft&rdquo;). The Apostles encourage them to steadfast
reliance upon the Spirit (&ldquo;Klein m&uuml;thige! H&ouml;rt
an was jetzt der Geist zu K&uuml;nden uns gebeut&rdquo;),
and the work comes to a close with a massive
chorale (&ldquo;Denn ihm ist alle Herrlichkeit von Ewigkeit
zu Ewigkeit&rdquo;), worked up with overpowering
dramatic force, particularly in the instrumentation.
Though but a small composition compared with
the masterpieces for the stage which followed it, it
is peculiarly interesting in its suggestions of the
composer&rsquo;s great dramatic power which was to find
its fruition in the later works from his pen.</p>

<h3>WEBER.</h3>
<p>Carl Maria von Weber was born
Dec. 18, 1786, at Eutin, and may almost
be said to have been born on the stage,
as his father was at the head of a theatrical
company, and the young Carl was carried in the
train of the wandering troupe all over Germany.
His first lessons were given to him by Henschkel,
conductor of the orchestra of Duke Friedrich of
Meiningen. At the age of fourteen he wrote his
first opera, &ldquo;Das Waldm&auml;dchen,&rdquo; which was performed
several times during the year 1800. In
1801 appeared his two-act comic opera, &ldquo;Peter
Schmoll and his Neighbors,&rdquo; and during these two
years he also frequently played in concerts with
great success. He then studied with the Abb&eacute;
Vogler, and in his eighteenth year was engaged for
the conductorship of the Breslau opera. About this
time appeared his first important opera, &ldquo;Rubezahl.&rdquo;
At the conclusion of his studies with Vogler
he was made director of the opera at Prague. In
1816 he went to Berlin, where he was received with
the highest marks of popular esteem, and thence to
<span class="pb" id="pg_343">[343]</span>
Dresden as hofcapellmeister. This was the most
brilliant period in his career. It was during this
time that he married Caroline Brandt, the actress
and singer, who had had a marked influence upon
his musical progress, and to whom he dedicated his
exquisite &ldquo;Invitation to the Dance.&rdquo; The first
great work of his life, &ldquo;Der Freisch&uuml;tz,&rdquo;
was written at this period. Three
other important operas followed,&mdash;&ldquo;Preciosa,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Euryanthe,&rdquo; the first performance
of which took place in Vienna in 1823,
and &ldquo;Oberon,&rdquo; which he finished in London and
brought out there. Weber&rsquo;s last days were spent
in the latter city, and it was while making preparations
to return to Germany, which he longed to see
again, that he was stricken down with his final illness.
On the 4th of June, 1826, he was visited by
Sir George Smart, Moscheles, and other musicians
who were eager to show him attention. He declined
to have any one watch by his bedside, thanked them
for their kindness, bade them good-by, and then
turned to his friend F&uuml;rstenau, and said, &ldquo;Now let
me sleep.&rdquo; These were his last words. The next
morning he was found dead in his bed. He has
left a rich legacy of works besides his operas,&mdash;a
large collection of songs, many cantatas (of which
the &ldquo;Jubilee&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kampf und Sieg&rdquo; are the
finest), some masses, of which that in E flat is the
most beautiful, and several concertos, besides many
brilliant rondos, polaccas, and marches for the
piano.</p>
</div>
<div id="c121" title="Jubilee Cantata">
<div class="pb" id="pg_344">[344]</div>
<h4>Jubilee Cantata.</h4>
<p>The &ldquo;Jubilee Cantata&rdquo; was written in 1818 to
celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the reign of
King Friedrich August of Saxony. The King having
expressed a desire that there should be a court
concert on the day of the anniversary, September 20,
Count Vitzthum commissioned Weber to write a
grand jubilee cantata. The poet Friedrich Kind
supplied the words. While engaged in its composition
Weber was informed by friends that other
arrangements were being made for the concert, and
on the 12th of September the information was confirmed
by a letter from the Count which informed
him that notwithstanding his personal protests, the
Jubilee Cantata was not to be given. The son in
his biography of his father intimates that the change
was the result of intrigues on the part of his Italian
rivals, Morlacchi, Zingarelli, and Nicolini. The
same authority says that the cantata was finally
produced in the Neustadt church for the benefit
of the destitute peasantry in the Hartz mountains,
Weber himself conducting the performance, and
that only the overture to the work, now famous the
world over as the &ldquo;Jubel,&rdquo; was played at the court
concert. The best authorities, however, now believe
that the Jubel overture is an entirely independent
work, having no connection with the cantata. The
text of the cantata, which commemorates many
special events in the life of the King, being found
unsuitable for general performance, a second text
<span class="pb" id="pg_345">[345]</span>
was subsequently written by Amadeus Wendt, under
the title of &ldquo;Ernte-Cantata&rdquo; (&ldquo;Harvest Cantata&rdquo;)
which is the one now in common use, although
still another version was made under the name of
&ldquo;The Festival of Peace,&rdquo; by Hampdon Napier,
which was used at a performance in London under
the direction of the composer himself only a few
days before his death.</p>
<p>The cantata is written for the four solo voices,
chorus, and orchestra. It opens after a short allegro
movement with a full jubilant chorus (&ldquo;Your thankful
Songs upraise&rdquo;), the solo quartet joining in the
middle part with chorus. The second number is a
very expressive recitative and aria for tenor (&ldquo;Happy
Nation, still receiving&rdquo;). The third is characterized
by quiet beauty, and is very devotional in spirit. It
begins with a soprano recitative and aria (&ldquo;Yet not
alone of Labor comes our Plenty&rdquo;), leading up to
a second recitative and aria (&ldquo;The gracious Father
hears us when we call&rdquo;), which are very vivacious
in style, closing with a tenor recitative (&ldquo;The Air
is mild and clear and grateful to the Reapers&rdquo;).
These prepare the way for a short but very powerful
chorus (&ldquo;Woe! see the Storm-Clouds&rdquo;). In the
next number (&ldquo;How fearful are the Terrors Nature
brings&rdquo;) the bass voice moralizes on the powers
of Nature, followed by a plaintive strain for two
sopranos, which leads up to a majestic prayer for
chorus (&ldquo;Lord Almighty, full of Mercy&rdquo;). A bass
recitative (&ldquo;Lo, once our Prayer&rdquo;) introduces a
beautiful quartet and chorus of thanksgiving
<span class="pb" id="pg_346">[346]</span>
(&ldquo;Wreathe into Garlands the Gold of the Harvest&rdquo;).
They are followed by a tenor recitative
and soprano solo (&ldquo;Soon noble Fruit by Toil was
won&rdquo;), and the work comes to a close with a
stately chorus of praise (&ldquo;Father, reigning in Thy
Glory&rdquo;).</p>
</div>
<div id="c122" title="Kampf Und Sieg">
<h4>Kampf und Sieg.</h4>
<p>In June, 1815, Weber arrived in Munich and
during his stay made the acquaintance of Fraulein
Wohlbr&uuml;ck, the singer, which led to an introduction
to her father, who was both an actor and a poet. On
the very day that he met Wohlbr&uuml;ck, the news came
to Munich of the victory of the Allies at Waterloo,
the whole city was decorated and illuminated, and a
great crowd, Weber with them, went to St. Michael&rsquo;s
Church to listen to a Te Deum. While there the
idea of a grand cantata in commemoration of the
victory came into his mind. On his return home
he met Wohlbr&uuml;ck and communicated his purpose
to him. The enthusiastic poet agreed to furnish
the words. About the first of August the text was
placed in Weber&rsquo;s hands, and he at once set it to
music. It was first produced on the 22d of December
at Prague, and made a profound impression
by its stirring military character and vivid battle-descriptions.</p>
<p>The cantata is written for the four solo voices,
chorus of sopranos, altos, two tenors, and basses
and orchestra. A stirring orchestral introduction
leads up to a people&rsquo;s chorus which describes the
<span class="pb" id="pg_347">[347]</span>
disappearance of dissensions heralding the approach
of victory. No. 3 is a bass solo entitled
&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; with a delightful violoncello accompaniment.
In No. 4, Love (soprano) and Hope (tenor)
join with Faith in a song full of feeling. No. 5 is a
soldiers&rsquo; chorus of an enthusiastic and martial character,
while in the distance is heard the Austrian
Grenadier&rsquo;s march mingling with it. In the next
number the approach of the enemy is heard as the
chorus closes with the majestic phrase, &ldquo;Mit Gott
sei unser Werk gethan.&rdquo; The lively march of the
enemy comes nearer and nearer, interwoven with
the next chorus, which is set to K&ouml;rner&rsquo;s prayer
&ldquo;Wie auch die H&ouml;lle braust.&rdquo; Then follows the
opening of the battle, with the roar of cannon, the
shouts of the soldiers, and the cries of the wounded,
through which is heard the French national air
defiantly sounding. Another soldiers&rsquo; chorus follows.
It pictures the advance of the Prussian
J&auml;gers (&ldquo;Ha! welch ein Klang&rdquo;), followed by the
simple strains of &ldquo;God save the King!&rdquo; In No. 9
the fight is renewed, the music reaching a pitch
of almost ferocious energy, until the joyous cry is
heard, &ldquo;Hurrah! Er flieht,&rdquo; and the triumphant
march of victory emphasizes the exultant p&aelig;an,
&ldquo;Heil dir im Siegerkranz.&rdquo; The rest of the cantata
is purely lyrical in style. Once more the voices of
&ldquo;Faith&rdquo; and &ldquo;Love&rdquo; are heard, leading up to the
final majestic chorus, &ldquo;Herr Gott, Dich loben wir,&rdquo;
accompanying a solo voice chanting the theme
&ldquo;Gieb und erhalte den Frieden der Welt.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>WHITING.</h3>
<p>George Elbridge Whiting was
born at Holliston, Mass., Sept. 14, 1842.
He began the study of the piano at a
very early age, but soon abandoned it for
the organ. His progress was so rapid that at the
age of thirteen he made his public appearance as a
player. In 1857 he went to Hartford, Conn., where
he had accepted a position in one of the churches,
and while there organized the Beethoven Society.
In 1862 he removed to Boston, but shortly afterwards
went to England, where he studied the organ
for a year with Best. On his return he was engaged
as organist of St. Joseph&rsquo;s Church, Albany, N. Y.,
but his ambition soon took him to Europe again.
This time he went to Berlin and finished his studies
with Radecke and Haupt. He then returned to
Albany and remained there three years, leaving that
city to accept a position at the church of the Immaculate
Conception, Boston. In 1874 he was
appointed organist at the Music Hall, and was also
for some time at the head of the organ department
of the New England Conservatory of Music. In
<span class="pb" id="pg_349">[349]</span>
1878 he was organist for the third Cincinnati May
Festival, and in 1879 accepted a position in the
College of Music in that city, at the same time
taking charge of the organ in the Music Hall, with
what success those who attended the May Festivals
in that city will remember. He remained in Cincinnati
three years and then returned to his old
position in Boston. Mr. Whiting ranks in the first
class of American organists, and has also been a prolific
composer. Among his vocal works are a mass
in C minor (1872); mass in F minor (1874);
prologue to Longfellow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Golden Legend&rdquo; (1873);
cantatas, &ldquo;Dream Pictures&rdquo; (1877), &ldquo;The Tale of
the Viking&rdquo; (1880); a concert overture (&ldquo;The
Princess&rdquo;); a great variety of organ music, including
&ldquo;The Organist,&rdquo; containing twelve pieces for
that instrument, and &ldquo;the First Six Months on the
Organ,&rdquo; with twenty-five studies; several concertos,
fantasies, and piano compositions, and a large number
of songs.</p>
</div>
<div id="c124" title="The Tale of the Viking">
<h4>The Tale of the Viking.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Tale of the Viking&rdquo; was written in competition
for the prize offered by the Cincinnati
Musical Festival Association in 1879, and though
unsuccessful, is still regarded as one of the most
admirable and scholarly works yet produced in this
country. The text of the cantata is Longfellow&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Skeleton in Armor,&rdquo; that weird and stirring story
<span class="pb" id="pg_350">[350]</span>
of the Viking, which the poet so ingeniously connected
with the old mill at Newport.</p>
<p>The work comprises ten numbers, and is written
for three solo voices (soprano, tenor, and barytone),
chorus, and orchestra. A long but very expressive
overture, full of the dramatic sentiment of the
poem, prepares the way for the opening number,
a short male chorus:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Speak! speak! thou fearful guest</p>
<p class="t0">Who, with thy hollow breast</p>
<p class="t0">Still in rude armor drest,</p>
<p class="t2">Comest to daunt me!</p>
<p class="t0">Wrapt not in Eastern balms,</p>
<p class="t0">But with thy fleshless palms</p>
<p class="t0">Stretched, as if asking alms,</p>
<p class="t2">Why dost thou haunt me?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Next comes a powerful chorus for mixed voices
(&ldquo;Then from those cavernous Eyes&rdquo;), which leads
up to the opening of the Viking&rsquo;s story (&ldquo;I was a
Viking old&rdquo;), a barytone solo, which is made very
dramatic by the skilful division of the song between
recitative and the melody. In the fourth number
the male chorus continues the narrative (&ldquo;But
when I older grew&rdquo;), describing in a vivacious and
spirited manner the wild life of the marauders on
the sea and their winter wassails as they told the
Berserker legends over their cups of ale. In the
fifth the soprano voice tells of the wooing of &ldquo;The
blue-eyed Maid&rdquo; in an aria (&ldquo;Once, as I told in
Glee&rdquo;) remarkable for its varying shades of expression.
At its close a brilliant march movement, very
<span class="pb" id="pg_351">[351]</span>
sonorous in style and highly colored, introduces a
vigorous chorus (&ldquo;Bright in her Father&rsquo;s Hall&rdquo;),
which describes the refusal of old Hildebrand to
give his daughter&rsquo;s hand to the Viking. A dramatic
solo for barytone (&ldquo;She was a Prince&rsquo;s Child&rdquo;)
pictures the flight of the dove with the sea-mew,
which is followed by a chorus of extraordinary
power as well as picturesqueness (&ldquo;Scarce had I
put to Sea&rdquo;), vividly describing the pursuit, the encounter,
and the Viking&rsquo;s escape with his bride. A
graceful but pathetic romance for tenor (&ldquo;There
lived we many Years&rdquo;), which relates her death, and
burial beneath the tower, leads to the closing number,
a soprano solo with a full stately chorus, admirably
worked up, picturing the death of the Viking,
who falls upon his spear, and ending in an exultant
and powerful burst of harmony, set to the words:&mdash;</p>
<div class="bq">
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;Thus, seamed with many scars,</p>
<p class="t0">Bursting these prison bars,</p>
<p class="t0">Up to its native stars</p>
<p class="t2">My soul ascended;</p>
<p class="t0">There from the flowing bowl</p>
<p class="t0">Deep drinks the warrior&rsquo;s soul,</p>
<p class="t0"><i>Skoal</i>! to the Northland! <i>skoal</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t2">Thus the tale ended.&rdquo;</p>
